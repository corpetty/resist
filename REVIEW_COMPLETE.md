## Remaining Considerations (Not Issues)

### Potential Future Additions

The following are referenced but don't have dedicated case studies. This is **intentional** (scope management), not an error:

1. **Bahrain uprising (2011)** - Arab Spring case, mentioned for comparison
2. **Yemen uprising (2011)** - Arab Spring case, mentioned for comparison  
3. **1956 Hungarian Revolution** - Historical reference for Soviet intervention comparison
4. **French Resistance (WWII)** - Historical reference for post-war justice discussion
5. **Zimbabwe independence** - Example of armed struggle leading to dictatorship
6. **Mozambique independence** - Example of armed struggle producing one-party state

These could be added as Tier 3 case studies if desired, but are not required for the current framework's coherence.

### Montgomery Bus Boycott Note

The Montgomery Bus Boycott is treated as **event within** [[US Civil Rights Movement]] rather than separate case study. This is appropriate given:
- It was part of broader Civil Rights Movement
- The case study for US Civil Rights Movement covers it
- Separate case study would be redundant
- References are clear in context

If a dedicated case study is desired later, all plain-text references can be easily converted back to wiki-links.
