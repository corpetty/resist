## Low Priority: Potential Factual Verification Needed

### Date/Timeline Checks

1. **Myanmar 2021 Resistance.md:**  
   - Described as "ongoing" as of 2026-01-31  
   - Ensure timeline accuracy (coup was February 1, 2021)

2. **Belarus 2020 Protests.md:**  
   - Election fraud was August 9, 2020  
   - Verify all dates are consistent

3. **Hong Kong Protests.md:**  
   - Should verify 2019-2020 timeline and 2020 National Security Law timing

### Casualty Figures Consistency

1. **Syrian Uprising:**  
   - Essay 3 says "half a million dead"  
   - Essay 9 says "500,000+ dead"  
   - Essay 10 says "500,000 die"  
   - **Check:** Consistent, but verify against case study

2. **Algerian Independence:**  
   - Essay 3 and 9 both say "300,000-1.5 million" (estimate range)  
   - **Check:** Verify case study uses same range

3. **Tiananmen Square:**  
   - Essay 8 mentions "massacre" but doesn't give numbers in essays  
   - **Check:** Ensure case study has accurate figures

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required

1. **Remove wiki-links for non-existent case studies**  
   - Change [[Bahrain Uprising]], [[Yemen Uprising]], [[French Resistance]], [[Hungarian Revolution 1956]], [[Zimbabwe Independence]], [[Mozambique Independence]] to plain text references

2. **Fix inconsistent case study names**  
   - Replace all [[Syria]] → [[Syrian Uprising]]  
   - Replace all [[Egypt]] → [[Egyptian Revolution 2011]]  
   - Replace all [[Hong Kong]] → [[Hong Kong Protests]]  
   - Replace [[Poland]] → [[Polish Solidarity]] in context

3. **Decide on Montgomery Bus Boycott**  
   - Either: Create dedicated case study (recommended given how often referenced)  
   - Or: Change all instances to plain text "the Montgomery Bus Boycott"  
   - Or: Link to [[US Civil Rights Movement]] with context

### Optional: Additional Case Studies to Consider

Given frequent references, these might warrant case studies:  
1. Bahrain Uprising (2011) - mentioned in Arab Spring context  
2. Yemen Uprising (2011) - mentioned in Arab Spring context  
3. Hungarian Revolution 1956 - mentioned for historical comparison  

However, these are lower priority than fixing broken links.

## Cross-Reference Verification

Need to verify that claims made in essays match the case study files:

1. **Polish Solidarity** - Essay 7 says "9 years" (1980-1989)  
   - Verify case study timeline matches

2. **Chilean Resistance** - Essays say "17 years" (1973-1990)  
   - Verify case study timeline matches

3. **Tunisian Revolution** - Essay 8 says "4 weeks"  
   - Verify case study says Dec 17, 2010 - Jan 14, 2011 (roughly 4 weeks)

4. **Velvet Revolution** - Essay 8 says "6 weeks"  
   - Verify case study timeline (should be late Oct/early Nov to late Dec 1989)
