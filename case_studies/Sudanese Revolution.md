# Sudanese Revolution 2018-19

## Overview

Sudan's revolution overthrew Omar al-Bashir's 30-year Islamist military dictatorship through sustained nonviolent resistance from December 2018 to August 2019. Beginning with protests against bread price increases, the movement escalated into demands for regime change, culminating in a months-long sit-in at military headquarters in Khartoum that forced Bashir's removal in April 2019. The movement featured innovative organizing (Sudanese Professionals Association, neighborhood resistance committees), prominent women's participation, and creative nonviolent tactics.

However, like Egypt 2011, the revolution was partially hijacked by the military. After the Khartoum sit-in massacre (June 3, 2019: 100+ killed), a power-sharing agreement established civilian-military transitional government, but military maintained dominance. A 2021 military coup suspended civilian government, and 2023 saw civil war erupt between rival military factions (SAF vs. RSF), devastating Sudan and displacing millions.

Theoretically, Sudan demonstrates successful mass mobilization removing entrenched dictators; innovative decentralized organizing (resistance committees); women's leadership in Middle East/Africa context; but also tragic pattern of military hijacking revolutions and ultimate descent into civil war, showing that overthrowing dictators doesn't guarantee democracy or even peace.

## Context

### Political

- **Regime type:** Authoritarian—Bashir's Islamist military dictatorship since 1989 coup; one-party rule; controlled opposition; security state; international pariah (ICC indictment for Darfur genocide)
- **State capacity:** Medium—military powerful but fractured; multiple security forces (army, RSF, NISS); corruption undermined efficiency; lost South Sudan (2011); economic crisis weakening state
- **Level of repression:** Very high—Darfur genocide (2003-present); political repression; torture; but weakened by economic crisis; sit-in massacre (June 2019) killed 100+
- **Elite cohesion/fracture:** Fractured—military divided; Bashir's power eroding; economic crisis alienating elite; rival generals (Burhan, Hemedti); but still coordinated against civilians initially
- **Political opportunity:** Economic collapse (inflation, fuel/bread shortages); loss of South Sudan oil revenue (2011); international isolation; corruption; generational change; regional Arab Spring legacy

### Economic

- **Economic conditions:** Economic collapse—hyperinflation; fuel and bread shortages; currency devaluation; loss of South Sudan oil (75% of revenue); subsidies ended; unemployment massive especially youth
- **Class composition of movement:** Cross-class—professionals (doctors, teachers, engineers) organized via SPA; students; urban poor; workers; women across classes; middle class central initially
- **Labor leverage:** High—SPA (doctors, teachers, etc.) organized strikes; general strikes paralyzed economy; professional class withdrawal crippled services
- **Resource availability:** Limited—crowdfunding; diaspora support; pooled resources; but low-budget organizing; resistance committees self-funded locally

### Social

- **Civil society strength:** Weak officially but underground networks strong—professional associations (basis for SPA); neighborhood ties; student groups; women's organizations; mosques; but decades of repression
- **Social networks:** Neighborhood resistance committees (critical innovation); professional networks (doctors, teachers); family and tribal ties; student groups; social media (Facebook, WhatsApp)
- **Key social cleavages:** Regional (Khartoum vs. periphery); ethnic (Arab vs. African identities); Darfur/South conflicts; religious (Islamic but diverse); class; but united against Bashir initially
- **Cultural factors:** Islamic identity (but diverse); Arab-African tensions; history of resistance (1964, 1985 uprisings); women's activism tradition; youth bulge; social media generation

### International

- **External support/opposition:** Gulf states (UAE, Saudi) initially supported Bashir then backed military; Egypt ambiguous; Ethiopia concerned; US partially engaged; international community limited leverage; Russia/China backing military
- **International attention:** High during sit-in; massacre shocked world; but limited sustained attention; 2023 civil war renewed focus
- **Geopolitical context:** Regional instability (Libya, South Sudan, Ethiopia); Gulf states' interest in Red Sea/Nile; great power competition; Bashir's ICC indictment isolation; post-Arab Spring

## Movement Characteristics

### Organization

- **Organizational form:** Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA—doctors, teachers, engineers); neighborhood resistance committees (decentralized cells); Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC—coalition); women's groups; student unions
- **Leadership structure:** SPA coordinated but decentralized; resistance committees autonomous neighborhood groups; FFC coalition leadership (political parties, armed groups, civil society); no single charismatic leader
- **Decision-making processes:** SPA coordination meetings; resistance committees consensus locally; FFC negotiated collectively; decentralized decision-making emphasized
- **Funding sources:** Crowdfunding; diaspora; individual contributions; pooled local resources; but minimal external funding
- **Infrastructure:** Neighborhood resistance committees as base; mosques; professional association offices; sit-in camps; social media; but improvised more than institutional

### Tactics

- **Primary tactics used:** Demonstrations and marches; sit-ins (especially military HQ sit-in April-June 2019); strikes (professional, general); neighborhood resistance committees; night protests (avoiding state of emergency); boycotts; creative art and music; candal (tea ladies) sustaining sit-in
- **Coordination level:** Moderate to high—SPA coordinated major actions; resistance committees autonomous but networked; social media shared tactics; sit-in self-organized with coordination
- **Violence level:** Overwhelmingly nonviolent from protesters—strict discipline despite massacres; regime violence extreme (June 3 massacre: 100+ killed, rape used as weapon); but protesters maintained nonviolence
- **Innovation or adaptation:** Resistance committees structure (enduring); neighborhood organizing; women's visibility and leadership; candal (tea ladies) as movement symbol; night protests; Kandaka (Nubian queen warrior) symbol; social media coordination

### Participants

- **Demographics:** Broad—professionals (doctors, teachers); students; women (very prominent—Alaa Salah "Kandaka" iconic); urban poor; middle class; youth majority; diverse ethnic/regional
- **Motivations:** Economic crisis (bread/fuel shortages); end dictatorship (30 years); corruption; injustice (Darfur, South); desire for democracy and freedom; generational change
- **Risk tolerance:** Very high—faced live ammunition, massacre; maintained sit-in despite threats; women risked sexual violence; but commitment sustained
- **Recruitment and retention:** Economic crisis affecting everyone; social media; professional networks; resistance committees; sit-in community; but massacre and coup caused disillusionment

## Theory of Change

- **Explicit or implicit theory:** Sustained protests + economic paralysis (strikes) → regime unsustainable → military removes Bashir (hoped military would side with revolution) → democratic transition; actual: military hijacked
- **Power mechanisms used:** Mass mobilization; economic (strikes); moral (nonviolence vs. brutality); social (resistance committees sustained); international pressure (limited)
- **Target of pressure:** Bashir regime; military (to defect or side with protesters); international community; Sudanese public (mobilize masses)
- **Intermediate goals:** End economic crisis; remove Bashir; transitional government; democratic elections; justice for massacres
- **Path to victory:** Protests → strikes → sit-in → Bashir removed (April 11) → power-sharing deal (August 2019) → but military coup (October 2021) and civil war (April 2023) reversed gains

## Dynamics

### Development

- **How did movement emerge?** December 19, 2018 bread protests (Atbara town) → spread nationwide → demands escalated to regime change → Khartoum sit-in (April 6) → built until Bashir removal
- **Growth trajectory:** December 2018 initial protests → January-March escalation → April 6 military HQ sit-in begins → April 11 Bashir removed → June 3 massacre → August power-sharing deal → October 2021 coup → April 2023 civil war
- **Key turning points:** Bread protests (December 19, 2018); Khartoum sit-in (April 6, 2019); Bashir ousted (April 11); June 3 massacre; power-sharing agreement (August 17, 2019); October 25, 2021 coup; April 2023 civil war
- **Evolution of tactics:** Protests → nationwide strikes → sustained sit-in → negotiations → resistance committees sustained organizing

### State Response

- **Initial response:** Repression (tear gas, live ammunition); state of emergency; internet shutdown; arrests; but protests spread
- **Repression tactics:** Live ammunition; June 3 massacre (100+ killed, bodies in Nile, rape used systematically); NISS and RSF violence; arrests and torture; but regime fragmenting
- **Concessions:** Bashir removed by military (April 11); Transitional Military Council formed; eventually power-sharing agreement (August); but military retained dominance and later coup
- **Counter-organization:** Regime loyalist rallies weak; military maneuvered to control transition; RSF (Hemedti) and SAF (Burhan) competed

### Internal Dynamics

- **Cohesion vs. fragmentation:** United against Bashir; fragmented in negotiations with military; resistance committees vs. FFC political leadership tensions; regional/ethnic differences emerged; 2021 coup divided movement
- **Internal conflicts:** Whether to trust military; negotiation terms; civilian leadership composition; dealing with armed groups; post-coup splits between accommodation and resistance
- **Leadership issues:** Decentralized structure (strength and weakness); FFC coalition internally divided; resistance committees grassroots but limited national coordination; no single figure like Egypt's Tahrir
- **Strategic debates:** How to relate to military; power-sharing terms; transitional justice vs. stability; 2021 coup response strategy

## Outcomes

### Immediate

- **Policy changes:** Bashir removed; Transitional Military Council then power-sharing government (civilian-military); some reforms initiated; economic changes attempted
- **Regime changes:** Bashir out (later convicted); transitional government (Hamdok civilian PM + Burhan military); but military retained veto power
- **Concessions won:** Bashir regime ended; some political opening; transitional justice steps; but military hijacked transition
- **Repression faced:** 100+ killed in June 3 massacre (likely higher); hundreds overall; thousands arrested; torture and rape systematic

### Long-term

- **Organizational legacies:** Resistance committees persist; SPA continues; FFC fragmented; diaspora activism; but October 2021 coup and April 2023 civil war devastated gains
- **Cultural/normative changes:** Women's activism visible (Kandaka symbol); revolutionary culture; but trauma and disillusionment; ongoing war (2023-present) catastrophic
- **Unintended consequences:** Military coup (October 2021); civil war between SAF and RSF (April 2023-present) killing thousands, displacing millions; humanitarian catastrophe; complete state collapse
- **Lessons learned:** Overthrowing dictators insufficient; military hijacks revolutions; resistance committees as durable structure; women's leadership powerful; but winning street different from securing democracy; military rivalries can destroy countries

## Analysis

### What Worked

- **Successful elements:** Removed Bashir (30-year dictator); SPA coordinated effectively; resistance committees innovative and durable; women's leadership visible and effective; sustained nonviolent discipline; sit-in creative and powerful
- **Why they worked:** Economic crisis motivated masses; SPA organized professional class; resistance committees local and resilient; nonviolence maintained moral authority; sit-in pressured military
- **Replicable factors:** Professional association organizing; neighborhood committees; women's visible leadership; sustained sit-ins; decentralized structure; creative tactics

### What Didn't Work

- **Failures and mistakes:** Couldn't prevent military takeover; trusted military too much; power-sharing agreement gave military veto; couldn't build strong civilian institutions fast; military rivalries led to civil war
- **Why they failed:** Military had guns and organization; civilian movement fragmented; no accountability mechanisms in transition; SAF-RSF rivalry explosive; economic crisis continued; Gulf states backed military
- **Avoidable vs. structural:** Some negotiation mistakes perhaps avoidable; but structural military power, economic crisis, regional dynamics, SAF-RSF rivalry extremely difficult; pattern of military hijacking (Egypt parallel)

### Key Lessons

- **For similar contexts:** Professional organizing powerful; neighborhood committees durable; women's leadership can succeed in conservative contexts; sustained nonviolence can remove dictators; but securing democratic transition against military requires different skills/strategy; military rivalries can destroy victories
- **For different contexts:** Success required specific factors—economic collapse, professional class organization, military divisions; but pattern of military hijacking may be regional (Arab world, Africa)
- **Theoretical insights:** Removing dictators and building democracy are separate challenges; decentralized movements strong at protest, weak at governance; military institutions outlast street movements; revolutions can lead to civil war; women's leadership changes movement culture; resistance committees as innovation

### Unanswered Questions

- **Counterfactuals:** What if sit-in hadn't been massacred? What if civilian-military power-sharing been different? What if SAF-RSF rivalry addressed? What if international intervention happened? Could armed resistance have worked better or worse?
- **Alternative strategies:** More confrontational with military early? Different transitional arrangements? International mediation? Regional intervention? Maintaining mobilization longer?
- **Debated interpretations:** Did revolution succeed (removed Bashir) or fail (military coup, civil war)? Was June 3 massacre turning point or inevitable? Could civilian government have succeeded given economic crisis? How much blame to military vs. civilians vs. international vs. Gulf states?
