# Chilean Resistance to Pinochet

## Overview

The Chilean resistance to Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship (1973-1990) combined nearly two decades of struggle across multiple strategies: armed resistance by the MIR and FPMR; mass protests and strikes; Catholic Church protection of dissidents; legal challenges; international solidarity; and ultimately a successful electoral campaign in the 1988 plebiscite. The resistance emerged immediately after the September 11, 1973 coup that overthrew Salvador Allende's democratically elected socialist government, and concluded with the October 1988 "No" vote rejecting Pinochet's continuation and the 1989 election of Patricio Aylwin.

What makes Chile's case theoretically important is the combination of strategies over time, the role of Pinochet's own institutional framework (1980 constitution requiring plebiscite) in enabling his ouster, and the successful transition despite a still-powerful military and embedded neoliberal economic model. The movement navigated between armed resistance that Pinochet used to justify repression and mass nonviolent mobilization that isolated the regime internationally. The 1988 plebiscite—where the opposition turned Pinochet's own legitimation mechanism against him—demonstrated strategic adaptation and the power of legal-electoral tactics even under dictatorship.

However, the negotiated transition left significant continuity: Pinochet remained army commander until 1998, the constitution and economic model persisted (requiring decades to reform), human rights justice was limited, and the post-dictatorship political system remained constrained by authoritarian enclaves. Chile thus illustrates both the possibilities and limits of transitional change.

## Context

### Political

- **Regime type:** Military dictatorship under junta led by Pinochet; extreme repression initially (1973-77); institutionalized authoritarian rule (1980 constitution); but maintained some legal forms
- **State capacity:** Very high—effective military and intelligence apparatus (DINA, later CNI); systematic repression; but dependent on economic performance and international tolerance
- **Level of repression:** Very high especially early—3,000+ killed or disappeared; torture systematic; tens of thousands imprisoned or exiled; but moderated somewhat after international pressure mid-1970s
- **Elite cohesion/fracture:** Military unified behind Pinochet until late 1980s; business elite supported regime due to economic policies; Catholic Church split but hierarchy increasingly opposed; fragmentation grew late 1980s
- **Political opportunity:** 1980 constitution's plebiscite requirement; economic crisis 1982-83; international pressure; eventual business elite concerns about stability

### Economic

- **Economic conditions:** Neoliberal economic model ("Chicago Boys"); initial crisis then growth; 1982-83 debt crisis and recession; inequality massive; but growth resumed mid-1980s
- **Class composition of movement:** Working class central (poblaciones, unions); students; professionals; middle class participated in protests; exile community; peasants
- **Labor leverage:** Moderate to high—copper miners crucial; general strikes 1983-84; but repression weakened unions; neoliberal model reduced labor power
- **Resource availability:** International solidarity networks provided funding; Catholic Church resources; exile communities; but severe resource constraints under repression

### Social

- **Civil society strength:** Decimated initially but rebuilt underground; Catholic Church (Vicariate of Solidarity) crucial protection; human rights organizations; women's groups; neighborhood associations (poblaciones)
- **Social networks:** Neighborhood (población) networks; union ties; Church parishes; student groups; exile communities; family networks
- **Key social cleavages:** Class (extreme inequality); urban/rural; political left fragmentation (socialists, communists, MIR); generational
- **Cultural factors:** Catholic Church influence; tradition of democratic politics (pre-1973); national trauma of coup; exile diaspora; strong political identities

### International

- **External support/opposition:** US supported coup and regime initially (Cold War anti-communism); international human rights movement provided solidarity; European social democrats supported opposition; UN and OAS pressure; eventual US distance from Pinochet
- **International attention:** High initially (coup violently ended democracy); human rights organizations focused on Chile; decline mid-1970s; renewed 1980s; massive attention to plebiscite
- **Geopolitical context:** Cold War justified regime to US; but Carter human rights policy increased pressure; Reagan initially warm but eventually critical; end of Cold War reduced regime's strategic value

## Movement Characteristics

### Organization

- **Organizational form:** Multiple organizations over time—MIR and other armed groups; Command for the No (1988 plebiscite campaign); Coalition of Parties for Democracy (Concertación); Church human rights organizations; labor unions (where permitted); student groups
- **Leadership structure:** No single leadership—armed groups had hierarchies; political parties underground; Church hierarchy moral authority; Command for the No coordinated plebiscite campaign; Concertación formed for transition
- **Decision-making processes:** Varied by organization; armed groups hierarchical; parties tried to maintain democratic procedures underground; Command for the No pragmatic coalition; but coordination difficult under repression
- **Funding sources:** International solidarity crucial; Church resources; small donations; exile community support; some party funding from abroad
- **Infrastructure:** Church buildings as refuges; underground networks; exile communities as bases; población organizations; universities when possible

### Tactics

- **Primary tactics used:** Armed resistance (MIR, FPMR); mass protests (especially 1983-86); general strikes; legal challenges; human rights documentation; international solidarity campaigns; cultural resistance; plebiscite campaign (1988)
- **Coordination level:** Low early (repression prevented); improved in protest cycle (1983-86); high for plebiscite campaign (Command for the No united opposition)
- **Violence level:** Mixed—armed resistance by MIR and FPMR included assassination attempts, bombings; mass protests mostly nonviolent but some rioting; regime violence extreme
- **Innovation or adaptation:** Turning Pinochet's plebiscite mechanism against him; creative media campaign for "No"; cultural resistance (music, art); international human rights framing

### Participants

- **Demographics:** Cross-class but working class central; youth/students active in protests; professionals in human rights work; women organized (against disappeared); exiles abroad
- **Motivations:** Restore democracy; end repression and torture; justice for disappeared; economic grievances (inequality, unemployment); political conviction; family losses
- **Risk tolerance:** Very high among armed resisters and early protesters; moderate in later mass protests; but severe repression meant participation costly
- **Recruitment and retention:** Repression created grievances; neighborhoods and families; political traditions; but fear and exile created attrition; 1988 plebiscite mobilized broadly

## Theory of Change

- **Explicit or implicit theory:** Multiple theories across time and factions—armed resistance would make country ungovernable (MIR); mass mobilization would force transition (protests 1983-86); legal-electoral strategy could use regime's own framework (plebiscite); international pressure would isolate regime
- **Power mechanisms used:** Armed violence (limited); mass mobilization; economic disruption (strikes); moral pressure; international isolation; legal-electoral challenge; media and culture
- **Target of pressure:** Military regime; business elite (wavering in 1980s); international community; Chilean public (plebiscite)
- **Intermediate goals:** Release prisoners; end torture; document human rights abuses; restore union rights; ultimately free elections
- **Path to victory:** Build opposition despite repression → exploit regime's own plebiscite requirement → unite opposition for No vote → force transition → negotiate terms

## Dynamics

### Development

- **How did movement emerge?** Immediately after 1973 coup; armed resistance by MIR and others; underground organizing; Church protection; evolved through phases
- **Growth trajectory:** Underground survival (1973-77) → rebuilding (late 1970s) → protest cycle (1983-86) → plebiscite focus (1987-88) → electoral victory (1988-89)
- **Key turning points:** 1973 coup; 1978 Letelier assassination (international backlash); 1980 constitution (created plebiscite mechanism); 1982-83 economic crisis (sparked protests); 1986 Pinochet assassination attempt (crackdown); 1988 plebiscite (No victory)
- **Evolution of tactics:** Armed resistance → mass protests → focus on plebiscite → electoral campaign

### State Response

- **Initial response:** Extreme repression—mass arrests, disappearances, torture, executions; destruction of left organizations; exile
- **Repression tactics:** Death squads (Caravan of Death); DINA torture centers; disappeared (desaparecidos); exile; later CNI continued repression; states of emergency; military control
- **Concessions:** Minor—some political opening late 1980s; accepted plebiscite loss (though reluctantly); negotiated transition; but retained military power
- **Counter-organization:** Propaganda; economic growth as legitimation; 1980 constitution as pseudo-democratic framework; but weak social base beyond military and business

### Internal Dynamics

- **Cohesion vs. fragmentation:** Opposition fragmented—communists vs. socialists; armed vs. nonviolent; exile vs. internal; but unified for plebiscite (Concertación)
- **Internal conflicts:** Whether to participate in regime's institutions or boycott; armed struggle vs. mass politics; terms of transition; justice vs. stability
- **Leadership issues:** No single leader like Havel or Mandela; collective leadership in Concertación; tensions between parties; Aylwin emerged as consensus candidate
- **Strategic debates:** Armed resistance effectiveness debated; when to shift to electoral strategy; how to deal with military in transition; justice for past crimes

## Outcomes

### Immediate

- **Policy changes:** Return to electoral democracy; Aylwin government (1990-94) initiated some reforms; Truth and Reconciliation Commission; but constitution and economic model largely unchanged
- **Regime changes:** Pinochet stepped down as president (1990) but remained army commander until 1998; democratic elections; but military retained influence
- **Concessions won:** Democracy restored; some political prisoners released; human rights violations acknowledged (though limited justice); but amnesty law protected perpetrators
- **Repression faced:** 3,000+ killed/disappeared; tens of thousands tortured; hundreds of thousands exiled; systematic state terror over 17 years

### Long-term

- **Organizational legacies:** Concertación governed until 2010; political party system partially restored; civil society organizations continued; but left significantly weakened
- **Cultural/normative changes:** Human rights discourse strengthened; memory battles over coup and dictatorship; neoliberal economic model normalized; democratic culture restored but constrained
- **Unintended consequences:** Constitution not fully replaced until 2022 referendum; economic model persisted; military retained privileges; Pinochet avoided full justice (died 2006); polarization over memory
- **Lessons learned:** Dictatorships can be ousted even without full power; using regime's own mechanisms possible; but negotiated transitions limit transformation; justice difficult

## Analysis

### What Worked

- **Successful elements:** Sustained resistance over 17 years; Church protection of activists; international solidarity; adapting strategy to plebiscite; united opposition (Command for No); creative campaign
- **Why they worked:** Regime eventually needed legitimation (plebiscite); economic crisis weakened support; Church had protected space; international pressure increased costs; opposition unified at crucial moment
- **Replicable factors:** Using authoritarian constitutions against regimes; importance of international solidarity; Church (or institutional) protection; strategic flexibility; creative campaigning

### What Didn't Work

- **Failures and mistakes:** Armed resistance probably counterproductive (gave regime justification); protest cycle 1983-86 didn't force transition; exile fragmented opposition; negotiated transition left much unchanged
- **Why they failed:** Armed resistance against strong military impossible to win; regime willing to repress mass protests; exile weakened internal organization; military still powerful in transition
- **Avoidable vs. structural:** Some strategic mistakes avoidable; but structural constraints—military power, business support, Cold War context, neoliberal model—limited transformation

### Key Lessons

- **For similar contexts:** Long struggles require multiple strategies over time; using authoritarian institutions against regime possible; international solidarity crucial; Church/institutional protection valuable; but negotiated transitions limit change
- **For different contexts:** Success depended on regime's own plebiscite requirement (not generalizable); economic crisis helped; Cold War ending reduced regime's value; Chile's prior democratic tradition aided
- **Theoretical insights:** Resistance can win without winning militarily; strategic adaptation crucial; timing matters (economic crisis, international context); winning different from transforming; amnesty laws and authoritarian enclaves persist

### Unanswered Questions

- **Counterfactuals:** What if armed resistance had been abandoned earlier? What if opposition boycotted plebiscite? What if economic crisis had been worse? What if Pinochet had refused plebiscite result?
- **Alternative strategies:** Could earlier focus on legal-electoral strategy have worked? Would more mass mobilization have forced better transition terms? Different approach to justice?
- **Debated interpretations:** Was transition success or compromise? Did armed resistance help or hurt? Was economic model's persistence inevitable? How much credit to internal vs. international pressure?
