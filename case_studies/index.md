## Contributing

When adding or updating case studies:

1. **Be evenhanded** - Analyze what worked and what didn't without ideological commitment
2. **Be honest** - Acknowledge uncertainty, failure, and moral complexity
3. **Be specific** - Ground claims in evidence, cite sources
4. **Be comparative** - Connect to other cases and framework concepts
5. **Update the index** - Add new cases to relevant sections here

See [[case_studies_database#Avoiding Common Pitfalls]] for methodological guidance.
