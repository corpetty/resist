# Polish Solidarity

## Overview

Solidarity (Solidarność) was a Polish trade union and social movement that emerged from strikes at the Gdańsk shipyard in August 1980. It became the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country, growing to nearly 10 million members—roughly a third of Poland's working-age population. The movement combined labor organizing, Catholic social teaching, and democratic aspirations into a broad coalition that challenged communist party rule.

After sixteen months of legal existence and growing influence, the government declared martial law in December 1981, banning Solidarity and imprisoning thousands of activists. The movement survived underground for seven years, maintaining networks, publishing samizdat, and preserving organizational capacity. When economic crisis and Soviet reform under Gorbachev created new openings in 1988-89, Solidarity re-emerged to negotiate the Round Table Agreement, leading to partially free elections in June 1989 that produced the first non-communist government in Eastern Europe.

Solidarity's success helped trigger the cascade of revolutions across Eastern Europe in 1989. It remains a paradigmatic case of successful nonviolent resistance under authoritarianism, though its post-victory trajectory—economic shock therapy, political fragmentation, and eventual conservative turn—complicates simple triumphalist narratives.

## Context

### Political

- **Regime type:** Communist one-party state under Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR); formally sovereign but within Soviet sphere of influence
- **State capacity:** Medium—capable of repression but economically dependent and facing legitimacy crisis; security services extensive but not totalitarian
- **Level of repression:** High during martial law (1981-83); moderate before and after; thousands interned but relatively few killed compared to other Soviet-bloc crackdowns
- **Elite cohesion/fracture:** Fractured—reformists vs. hardliners within Party; military (Jaruzelski) somewhat autonomous; Church as parallel elite structure
- **Political opportunity:** Economic crisis delegitimized regime; 1979 papal visit galvanized society; Soviet intervention less certain than in 1956 or 1968; Gorbachev's reforms after 1985 changed calculus

### Economic

- **Economic conditions:** Severe economic crisis—debt, shortages, inflation; 1970s borrowing from West created dependency; failed price reforms triggered 1980 strikes
- **Class composition of movement:** Workers (especially industrial) at core; intellectuals provided ideas and documentation; farmers had parallel Rural Solidarity; cross-class coalition
- **Labor leverage:** High—industrial workers in strategic sectors (shipyards, mines, steel) could paralyze economy; Poland's export dependence increased leverage
- **Resource availability:** Union dues during legal period; Church provided sanctuary, printing, meeting space; Western support (AFL-CIO, CIA, Vatican) during underground period

### Social

- **Civil society strength:** Weak formal civil society under communism but strong informal networks; Catholic Church provided alternative institutional structure; pre-war democratic traditions
- **Social networks:** Church parishes; workplace networks; intellectual circles (KOR); regional identities; underground networks during martial law
- **Key social cleavages:** Workers vs. intellectuals (tension within movement); secular vs. religious; regional (coastal, Silesian, Warsaw); generational
- **Cultural factors:** Polish nationalism and Catholic identity intertwined; historical resistance to partition and occupation; Pope John Paul II as symbol; culture of "living in truth"

### International

- **External support/opposition:** Soviet Union as ultimate guarantor of communist rule but increasingly unwilling to intervene; Western moral and material support; Vatican active role
- **International attention:** High—Western media coverage, especially during 1980-81 and martial law; Nobel Peace Prize to Wałęsa (1983); symbol of Cold War resistance
- **Geopolitical context:** Détente and its collapse; Reagan administration support; Gorbachev's reforms and non-intervention doctrine; broader Eastern European ferment

## Movement Characteristics

### Organization

- **Organizational form:** Trade union (legally registered 1980-81); underground network (1981-89); combined with Catholic Church infrastructure; later political party/coalition
- **Leadership structure:** Lech Wałęsa as charismatic leader and symbol; National Coordinating Commission; regional structures; intellectual advisors (Michnik, Kuroń, Geremek)
- **Decision-making processes:** Formally democratic union structures; tension between Wałęsa's personal authority and democratic accountability; regional autonomy
- **Funding sources:** Member dues (legal period); Western labor unions (AFL-CIO); covert CIA support; Church resources; émigré contributions
- **Infrastructure:** Shipyards and factories as organizing base; Catholic churches as sanctuary; underground printing; Radio Free Europe broadcasts

### Tactics

- **Primary tactics used:** Strikes (sit-down strikes in 1980); negotiation; civil resistance; underground publishing and organizing; boycotts of official structures; Round Table negotiations
- **Coordination level:** High—national coordination during legal period; decentralized but connected underground networks during martial law
- **Violence level:** None—strict nonviolent discipline; movement absorbed violence rather than inflicting it
- **Innovation or adaptation:** Sit-down strikes prevented regime from using force without destroying factories; underground "society" parallel structures; Round Table negotiation model

### Participants

- **Demographics:** Industrial workers (core); intellectuals; students; farmers; women active but male-dominated leadership; cross-generational
- **Motivations:** Material grievances (wages, conditions, shortages); dignity and self-governance; national and religious identity; political freedom
- **Risk tolerance:** High—participants faced job loss, arrest, imprisonment; some killed; maintained commitment through seven years underground
- **Recruitment and retention:** Workplace networks; Church connections; samizdat culture; maintained identity through underground period

## Theory of Change

- **Explicit or implicit theory:** Build alternative society ("new evolutionism"); maintain pressure and organization until regime weakened; negotiate transition when opportunity arose
- **Power mechanisms used:** Economic leverage (strikes); moral authority; parallel institutions; international pressure; negotiation from strength
- **Target of pressure:** Communist party and state; but also building capacity for self-governance regardless of regime response
- **Intermediate goals:** Legal union recognition; improved conditions; free speech; ultimately free elections and end of communist rule
- **Path to victory:** Organize → gain legal recognition → survive repression underground → negotiate transition when regime weakened

## Dynamics

### Development

- **How did movement emerge?** Built on 1970 and 1976 worker protests; KOR (1976) linked workers and intellectuals; August 1980 Gdańsk shipyard strike spread nationally; Gdańsk Agreement recognized Solidarity
- **Growth trajectory:** Explosive growth August-December 1980 (10 million members); sixteen months of "carnival"; martial law crushed legal movement; seven years underground; re-emergence 1988-89
- **Key turning points:** Gdańsk Agreement (August 1980); martial law declaration (December 1981); Wałęsa Nobel Prize (1983); 1988 strikes; Round Table Agreement (1989); June 1989 elections
- **Evolution of tactics:** Legal union activity → underground resistance → renewed strikes → negotiated transition → electoral politics

### State Response

- **Initial response:** Regime conceded to strikes (Gdańsk Agreement); attempted to contain and co-opt; internal debate over how to respond
- **Repression tactics:** Martial law (December 1981); mass internment; union banned; media blackout; militarization of workplaces; but relatively limited violence compared to Hungary 1956 or Czechoslovakia 1968
- **Concessions:** Legal union recognition (1980); various agreements; ultimately Round Table and free elections (1989)
- **Counter-organization:** Attempted official unions; propaganda; but regime lacked legitimacy and capacity for sustained counter-mobilization

### Internal Dynamics

- **Cohesion vs. fragmentation:** Remarkable unity during 1980-81; maintained solidarity (literally) underground; some fragmentation in late 1980s over negotiation strategy
- **Internal conflicts:** Workers vs. intellectuals; radicals vs. moderates; Wałęsa's leadership style controversial; debates over negotiation vs. continued resistance
- **Leadership issues:** Wałęsa charismatic but sometimes erratic; tension between his authority and democratic norms; leadership continuity maintained despite repression
- **Strategic debates:** How far to push in 1980-81; whether to negotiate under martial law; terms of Round Table; pace of transition; economic policy after victory

## Outcomes

### Immediate

- **Policy changes:** Legal independent union (1980-81); Round Table agreements (1989); partially free elections; non-communist government
- **Regime changes:** First non-communist government in Eastern Europe (Mazowiecki, August 1989); triggered regional cascade; communist party dissolved
- **Concessions won:** Union rights; political freedoms; free elections; end of communist rule; democratic constitution
- **Repression faced:** Martial law; thousands interned; some killed; economic pressure; surveillance; but movement survived

### Long-term

- **Organizational legacies:** Solidarity continued as union and political force but fragmented; democratic institutions established; but Solidarity brand eventually captured by conservative nationalists
- **Cultural/normative changes:** Democratic norms established; civil society legitimized; but also nostalgia and contested memory; Church's political role debated
- **Unintended consequences:** Economic shock therapy caused hardship; political fragmentation; eventual rise of illiberal PiS (Law and Justice) party with Solidarity roots
- **Lessons learned:** Underground organizing can maintain movement through repression; negotiated transitions possible; but managing post-victory period extremely difficult

## Analysis

### What Worked

- **Successful elements:** Worker-intellectual alliance; Church sanctuary and legitimacy; nonviolent discipline; organizational persistence through martial law; strategic patience; skilled negotiation
- **Why they worked:** Regime economically weak and ideologically exhausted; Soviet intervention became less likely; broad social coalition maintained unity; leadership combined charisma with strategic sense
- **Replicable factors:** Building coalitions across class lines; using existing institutions (Church, workplaces); maintaining organization through repression; strategic patience; negotiating from strength

### What Didn't Work

- **Failures and mistakes:** Arguably pushed too hard in 1980-81, provoking martial law; post-victory economic shock therapy caused suffering; movement failed to translate into stable democratic party
- **Why they failed:** Regime retained capacity for repression in 1981; post-communist economic transition inherently painful; movement unity easier in opposition than governance
- **Avoidable vs. structural:** Martial law possibly unavoidable given Soviet context; economic difficulties partly structural; political fragmentation perhaps avoidable with different choices

### Key Lessons

- **For similar contexts:** Authoritarian regimes with economic weakness vulnerable; maintaining organization through repression possible with sanctuary institutions; negotiated transitions require both pressure and willingness to compromise
- **For different contexts:** Success depended on specific factors—Catholic Church, Soviet constraints, industrial economy; nonviolence worked partly because regime constrained from maximum force
- **Theoretical insights:** Social movements can survive severe repression if they have institutional bases; transitions require both mobilization and elite negotiation; winning is different from governing

### Unanswered Questions

- **Counterfactuals:** What if Solidarity had been more cautious in 1980-81? What if Gorbachev hadn't risen? What if different economic policies had been chosen after 1989?
- **Alternative strategies:** Could armed resistance have worked? Would slower transition have been possible? Different Round Table terms?
- **Debated interpretations:** How much credit to Solidarity vs. Soviet collapse? Role of Western support (especially CIA)? Whether shock therapy was necessary? Solidarity's responsibility for later illiberalism?
