# People Power Revolution (Philippines)

## Overview

The People Power Revolution of February 1986 was a four-day uprising that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos's 20-year dictatorship through massive nonviolent resistance combined with crucial military defection. The revolution began when reformist military officers, facing discovery of their coup plot, sought protection at military camps along EDSA (Epifanio de los Santos Avenue) in Manila. Cardinal Jaime Sin called on Filipinos to protect the defectors, and millions responded, creating a human shield that prevented loyalist forces from crushing the rebellion.

What distinguished People Power from other uprisings was its speed and the critical role of military defection. Within four days, millions of civilians on EDSA, key military units switching sides, and international pressure (particularly from the United States) combined to make Marcos's position untenable. He fled to Hawaii on February 25, and Corazon Aquino, widow of assassinated opposition leader Benigno Aquino, assumed the presidency.

The revolution influenced subsequent movements worldwide (inspiring the term "people power") and demonstrated that nonviolent mass action combined with elite defection could rapidly topple apparently entrenched dictatorships. However, the post-revolution trajectory—including attempted coups, continued oligarchic politics, and incomplete democratic consolidation—complicates triumphalist narratives.

## Context

### Political

- **Regime type:** Authoritarian—martial law (1972-81) followed by civilianized but still authoritarian rule; electoral facade with manipulation; military and crony capitalism
- **State capacity:** Medium—effective repression apparatus but dependent on military loyalty; corruption undermined efficiency; regional insurgencies (communist NPA, Muslim separatists) stretched resources
- **Level of repression:** High—thousands killed or disappeared under martial law; torture; media censorship; but selective rather than totalitarian; some space for opposition (especially Church)
- **Elite cohesion/fracture:** Fractured—military split between loyalists and reformists; business elite alienated by crony capitalism; Catholic hierarchy opposed regime; US support wavering
- **Political opportunity:** Benigno Aquino assassination (1983) galvanized opposition; fraudulent 1986 election; military coup plot; US reconsidering support under Reagan

### Economic

- **Economic conditions:** Economic crisis by mid-1980s; debt burden; crony capitalism enriched Marcos allies; poverty widespread; "miracle" growth of 1970s reversed
- **Class composition of movement:** Cross-class coalition—middle class central; urban poor; some business elite; military officers; professionals; students
- **Labor leverage:** Moderate—some union involvement but labor not primary driver; urban economy provided concentration
- **Resource availability:** Church infrastructure and resources; opposition funded partly by business interests opposed to cronies; diaspora remittances important to economy

### Social

- **Civil society strength:** Strong Catholic Church (80%+ population); professional associations; universities; despite repression, civil society persisted
- **Social networks:** Church parishes as organizing hubs; professional networks; family ties; regional associations; Radio Veritas broadcasts
- **Key social cleavages:** Class; regional; religious (Catholic majority, Muslim minority in south); linguistic diversity; patron-client political culture
- **Cultural factors:** Catholic social teaching; tradition of people power (1896 revolution); family networks; concept of hiya (shame); religious devotion mobilizable

### International

- **External support/opposition:** US critical—Reagan administration initially supported Marcos but Senator Lugar and others pushed for change; final US pressure on Marcos to leave decisive
- **International attention:** High—fraudulent election observed internationally; US media coverage; global Catholic networks
- **Geopolitical context:** Cold War—Marcos as anti-communist ally; but US bases (Clark, Subic) created leverage; post-Vietnam US less willing to back unpopular dictators unconditionally

## Movement Characteristics

### Organization

- **Organizational form:** Coalition of opposition parties (UNIDO), Catholic Church, reformist military (RAM), civil society organizations; mobilization networks through parishes
- **Leadership structure:** Cardinal Sin provided moral authority and mobilization call; Corazon Aquino as electoral opposition candidate; reformist military officers (Enrile, Ramos); no single command structure
- **Decision-making processes:** Decentralized—different actors made autonomous decisions; Cardinal Sin's Radio Veritas calls coordinated crowds; improvised coordination during four-day revolution
- **Funding sources:** Opposition political funding; Church resources; business contributions; diaspora support
- **Infrastructure:** Church parishes and Radio Veritas central; Aquino campaign organization; military facilities once defection occurred

### Tactics

- **Primary tactics used:** Mass demonstrations; human shields around military camps; nuns with flowers facing tanks; civil disobedience; occupying EDSA; electoral challenge (February 7 election)
- **Coordination level:** High considering speed—Cardinal Sin's radio calls mobilized millions; word-of-mouth and telephone trees; but improvised rather than pre-planned
- **Violence level:** Minimal from protesters—strict nonviolent discipline; nuns confronting tanks became iconic image; prevented violence even under provocation
- **Innovation or adaptation:** Human shield tactic (millions protecting defecting military); Radio Veritas coordination; combining electoral challenge with street action

### Participants

- **Demographics:** Broad cross-section—middle class (nuns, professionals, families); students; urban poor; military defectors; elderly; children; across regions
- **Motivations:** Restore democracy; end corruption and cronyism; national pride; religious conviction; economic grievances; support for Aquino family legacy
- **Risk tolerance:** Varied—human shields accepted risk of violence; most participants probably underestimated danger initially; maintained courage when tanks appeared
- **Recruitment and retention:** Cardinal Sin's calls mobilized Catholic population; social networks; radio broadcasts; momentum built over four days; visible military defection reduced perceived risk

## Theory of Change

- **Explicit or implicit theory:** Mass mobilization combined with military defection would make Marcos's position untenable; US would pressure Marcos to leave rather than support massacre; international attention would constrain violence
- **Power mechanisms used:** Moral pressure; physical barrier (human shield); military defection removing regime's enforcement capacity; international (especially US) pressure; economic disruption
- **Target of pressure:** Wavering military units; US government; Marcos personally (isolating him); Philippine public opinion
- **Intermediate goals:** Protect defecting military officers; prevent violence; demonstrate popular will; force Marcos to leave
- **Path to victory:** Fraudulent election → military defection → mass protection → loyalist troops refuse orders → US pressure → Marcos departure

## Dynamics

### Development

- **How did movement emerge?** Built on years of opposition post-Aquino assassination (1983); snap election called by Marcos (February 7, 1986); fraudulent results; military coup plot discovered; defection to EDSA camps
- **Growth trajectory:** February 7 fraudulent election → opposition protests → February 22 military defection → Cardinal Sin calls for protection → millions gather on EDSA → four days → Marcos flees February 25
- **Key turning points:** Aquino assassination (August 21, 1983); fraudulent election (February 7, 1986); Enrile/Ramos defection (February 22); Cardinal Sin's radio call (February 22); Marcos departure (February 25)
- **Evolution of tactics:** Electoral challenge → military defection → mass nonviolent shield → US pressure → regime collapse

### State Response

- **Initial response:** Marcos declared himself winner of fraudulent election; attempted to crush military defection; ordered tanks to EDSA camps
- **Repression tactics:** Electoral fraud; propaganda; attempted military action; but critical failure when soldiers refused to fire on civilians
- **Concessions:** Marcos held inauguration ceremony but position untenable; ultimately fled rather than order massacre (under US pressure)
- **Counter-organization:** Loyalist military units; but crucial defections undermined capacity; some units refused orders to fire

### Internal Dynamics

- **Cohesion vs. fragmentation:** Opposition maintained unity during revolution; post-revolution fragmented quickly (attempted coups, political conflicts)
- **Internal conflicts:** Tension between Aquino civilian government and military reformists; left suspicious of elite-led change; regional insurgencies continued
- **Leadership issues:** Corazon Aquino reluctant leader but provided unifying figure; Cardinal Sin's moral authority; Enrile/Ramos military credibility; but unclear power-sharing post-victory
- **Strategic debates:** How to respond to fraudulent election; whether to support military defection; terms of transition; dealing with Marcos loyalists

## Outcomes

### Immediate

- **Policy changes:** New constitution (1987); restoration of civil liberties; dismantling of martial law apparatus
- **Regime changes:** Marcos regime ended; Aquino presidency; return to electoral democracy
- **Concessions won:** Democratic restoration; freedom of press and assembly; end to dictatorship; but oligarchic politics largely unchanged
- **Repression faced:** Relatively limited during four-day revolution itself (crucial to success); years of prior repression under Marcos

### Long-term

- **Organizational legacies:** Democracy restored but fragile; military attempted coups (1989); Catholic Church remained political force; civil society active but limited transformation
- **Cultural/normative changes:** "People power" became global symbol; democratic norms re-established; but patron-client politics persistent; memory contested
- **Unintended consequences:** Incomplete revolution—economic elites largely unchanged; military remained political force; regional insurgencies continued; democratic institutions weak
- **Lessons learned:** Nonviolent uprising can succeed with military defection; speed can prevent regime counter-mobilization; international pressure matters; but winning different from transforming

## Analysis

### What Worked

- **Successful elements:** Military defection removed regime's enforcement tool; Church mobilization brought millions; strict nonviolent discipline; speed prevented counter-mobilization; US pressure on Marcos; clear alternative (Aquino)
- **Why they worked:** Regime isolated (military split, US wavering, economic crisis); Church had massive credibility and infrastructure; nonviolence prevented justification for massacre; Aquino provided legitimate alternative
- **Replicable factors:** Combining mass action with elite defection; church/religious institution mobilization; strict nonviolent discipline; speed of action; clear alternative leader

### What Didn't Work

- **Failures and mistakes:** Post-revolution transformation incomplete; economic oligarchy unchanged; attempted coups showed fragile consolidation; military retained political role
- **Why they failed:** Revolution removed Marcos but didn't transform underlying structures; elite-led change limited scope; military defectors had own agenda; US wanted stability over transformation
- **Avoidable vs. structural:** Some post-revolution instability avoidable with different choices; but elite-led uprising structurally limited in transformation; military defectors not revolutionaries

### Key Lessons

- **For similar contexts:** Military defection crucial against dictatorships dependent on armed forces; religious institutions can mobilize rapidly; speed can be advantage; nonviolent discipline powerful when regime hesitates; international pressure (especially US in Cold War context) can be decisive
- **For different contexts:** Success required specific factors—Catholic Church, military divisions, US leverage, Aquino as unifying figure; may not transfer to contexts without these; shows importance of elite fracture
- **Theoretical insights:** Revolutions can succeed rapidly with right combination; nonviolence works when regime unwilling to massacre; but speed and elite-led change limit transformation; winning power different from transforming society

### Unanswered Questions

- **Counterfactuals:** What if military hadn't defected? What if Marcos had ordered massacre? What if US had continued support? What if more radical transformation attempted?
- **Alternative strategies:** Could armed uprising have worked? Would slower transformation been more sustainable? Different approach to military and oligarchs?
- **Debated interpretations:** Was this genuine people power or elite-orchestrated regime change? How much credit to military defectors vs. civilian mobilization vs. Church vs. US? Did revolution succeed or just replace one elite with another?
