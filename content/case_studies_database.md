## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**Selection Bias**
- Don't only study successes
- Include failed movements
- Study movements that never got off ground
- Recognize survivorship bias

**Confirmation Bias**
- Seek disconfirming evidence
- Consider alternative interpretations
- Note uncertainties and debates
- Avoid cherry-picking examples

**Context Blindness**
- Specify unique vs. replicable factors
- Identify necessary vs. sufficient conditions
- Recognize contingency and luck
- Avoid false universalization

**Participant Bias**
- Consider multiple perspectives
- State, movement, bystanders
- Different factions within movements
- Temporal distance and interpretation

**Outcome Bias**
- Success doesn't prove strategy was optimal
- Failure doesn't prove strategy was wrong
- Consider counterfactuals carefully
- Distinguish luck from skill

## Integration with Framework

Each case study should:
1. Illuminate specific framework dimensions
2. Test theoretical propositions
3. Provide examples for essays
4. Enable comparative analysis
5. Generate new questions
6. Refine analytical categories

Case studies are not just illustrations but research:
- They test theory
- They generate theory
- They reveal complexity
- They ground abstraction
- They honor participants

---

## Living Document

This database should:
- Be continuously updated
- Incorporate new research
- Revise interpretations
- Add contemporary cases
- Respond to debates
- Remain open to correction

The goal is comprehensive understanding, not ideological vindication.
