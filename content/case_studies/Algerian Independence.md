## Overview

The Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962) was a brutal anti-colonial armed struggle in which the FLN (Front de Libération Nationale) waged guerrilla warfare and terrorism against French colonial rule, ultimately forcing France to grant independence despite military superiority. The war killed between 300,000 and 1.5 million Algerians (estimates vary wildly), tens of thousands of French soldiers, and produced massive refugee flows. France employed torture, collective punishment, resettlement camps, and counter-insurgency tactics; the FLN used guerrilla warfare, urban terrorism (Battle of Algiers), and political mobilization.

Algeria achieved independence in July 1962 through the Évian Accords, but the victory came at catastrophic human cost. The war radicalized both sides—pieds-noirs (European settlers) and French military attempted coups (OAS terrorism); the FLN became authoritarian liberation movement that established one-party state post-independence. The war traumatized France (contributing to Fourth Republic collapse), forced ~1 million pieds-noirs to flee, and left Algeria economically devastated.

Theoretically, Algeria is crucial for debates about armed resistance effectiveness. It demonstrates that armed struggle can defeat colonial powers with massive cost; contrasts sharply with Indian nonviolent independence; influenced decolonization worldwide (especially Fanon's writings); but also shows violence's long-term costs—authoritarian outcome, mass death, trauma, economic destruction. The question remains whether nonviolent resistance could have achieved independence or whether France's settler colonialism made violence inevitable.

## Context

### Political

- **Regime type:** Colonial—French rule since 1830; Algeria legally part of France (départements); ~1 million European settlers (pieds-noirs); indigenous Algerians denied full citizenship
- **State capacity:** Very high—French military powerful; extensive police; administrative control; but overstretched by Indochina war legacy; Fourth Republic political instability
- **Level of repression:** Very high—systematic torture; collective punishment; resettlement camps (2+ million); massacres (Sétif 1945: thousands killed); summary executions
- **Elite cohesion/fracture:** French political elite divided—military vs. politicians; settlers vs. metropolitan; Fourth Republic unstable; De Gaulle eventually chose withdrawal
- **Political opportunity:** Post-WWII decolonization wave; Indochina defeat (1954); UN anti-colonial pressure; Cold War context; French political instability; Suez Crisis (1956)

### Economic

- **Economic conditions:** Colonial extraction economy; land expropriation from Algerians; settlers controlled best land; unemployment and poverty among Algerians; dual economy
- **Class composition of movement:** Peasants (majority); urban workers; educated middle class (initial leadership); but eventually mass national movement
- **Labor leverage:** Limited—strikes occurred but armed struggle primary; French controlled economy; diaspora workers in France
- **Resource availability:** External support (Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco bases; Eastern Bloc arms; China); diaspora funding; taxation of Algerians; but resource constraints severe

### Social

- **Civil society strength:** Weak—French repression destroyed organizations; Muslim associations restricted; underground FLN cells; French control pervasive
- **Social networks:** Village and tribal networks; family ties; diaspora (Algerian workers in France); mosques; FLN built parallel structures
- **Key social cleavages:** Colonizer/colonized fundamental; Arab/Berber (ethnicity); urban/rural; harkis (Algerians who fought for France) vs. FLN; Muslim religious identity
- **Cultural factors:** Islam central to identity; memory of conquest and resistance; Arab and Berber cultures; French cultural imposition; colonialism's racialized hierarchy

### International

- **External support/opposition:** Egypt (Nasser) supported FLN; Tunisia and Morocco provided bases; Eastern Bloc and China provided arms; UN condemned colonialism; US ambivalent; France had NATO allies
- **International attention:** Very high—France in NATO; decolonization issue; Cold War context; UN debates; French intellectuals (Sartre, Camus) debated; global left supported FLN
- **Geopolitical context:** Cold War—FLN sought Soviet and Chinese support but non-aligned; decolonization wave (India 1947, Indochina 1954); African independence movements; Suez Crisis 1956; France's great power decline

## Movement Characteristics

### Organization

- **Organizational form:** FLN (political wing) and ALN (armed wing); hierarchical military structure; external leadership (in Cairo, Tunis) and internal (maquis guerrillas); later GPRA (provisional government)
- **Leadership structure:** Collective leadership initially (nine historic chiefs); fractious and violent internal conflicts; Ben Bella emerged; but authoritarianism and purges
- **Decision-making processes:** Top-down military command; political debates among leadership in exile; but internal violence and power struggles; authoritarian tendencies
- **Funding sources:** Taxation of Algerian diaspora (France); external support (Egypt, Eastern Bloc, China); local taxation; bank robberies; but chronic resource shortages
- **Infrastructure:** Guerrilla bases in mountains; safe houses; external bases (Tunisia, Morocco); urban networks; parallel administration in liberated zones

### Tactics

- **Primary tactics used:** Guerrilla warfare (hit-and-run attacks); urban terrorism (bombings—Battle of Algiers); assassinations; strikes; demonstrations; political mobilization; international diplomacy
- **Coordination level:** Moderate—FLN attempted centralization but wilayas (regional commands) autonomous; internal conflicts and purges; fragmentation
- **Violence level:** Very high from both sides—FLN attacks on military and civilians (including Europeans and "collaborators"); France systematic torture, collective punishment, massacres; spiraling brutality
- **Innovation or adaptation:** Urban terrorism (Battle of Algiers); combining armed struggle with political mobilization; international solidarity campaigns; targeting French in France

### Participants

- **Demographics:** Initially young men (guerrillas); expanded to mass participation (strikes, demonstrations); women combatants (famous); peasants and workers; intellectuals in leadership
- **Motivations:** End colonial oppression; land expropriation grievances; racial hierarchy resentment; nationalist identity; Islamic identity; economic exploitation; Sétif massacre memory (1945)
- **Risk tolerance:** Extremely high—faced torture, death, collective punishment; families targeted; but desperation and commitment sustained; martyrdom celebrated
- **Recruitment and retention:** French repression drove recruitment (torture radicalized); nationalism and Islam mobilized; FLN coercion of Algerians; village networks; external training camps

## Theory of Change

- **Explicit or implicit theory:** Armed struggle would make French rule unsustainable; international pressure would increase; metropolitan France would tire of costs; military victory impossible but making Algeria ungovernable sufficient
- **Power mechanisms used:** Military (guerrilla attacks); economic (disruption); political (international diplomacy); moral (anti-colonialism); coercion of population
- **Target of pressure:** French military and settlers; French metropolitan opinion; international (UN, Third World, Cold War powers); Algerians (enforce participation)
- **Intermediate goals:** Drive out French; prevent compromise solutions; international recognition; mobilize Algerian masses; ultimately independence
- **Path to victory:** Guerrilla war → unsustainable costs → French political crisis → negotiated withdrawal

## Dynamics

### Development

- **How did movement emerge?** Long history of resistance; Sétif massacre (1945); MTLD and earlier movements; November 1, 1954 Toussaint Rouge (Red All Saints' Day) attacks launched war
- **Growth trajectory:** 1954 initial attacks → 1956-57 Battle of Algiers → 1958 French crisis and De Gaulle → 1960-61 negotiations → 1962 Évian Accords and independence
- **Key turning points:** November 1, 1954 start; Sétif uprising (1945 radicalized); Battle of Algiers (1956-57); De Gaulle taking power (1958); OAS terrorism (1961-62); Évian Accords (March 1962); independence (July 1962)
- **Evolution of tactics:** Rural guerrilla war → urban terrorism → combination → political negotiations

### State Response

- **Initial response:** Military repression; "pacification"; police action; but escalated to massive counter-insurgency
- **Repression tactics:** Systematic torture (widespread); collective punishment; resettlement camps (2+ million displaced); summary executions; Battle of Algiers crackdown (Massu paratroopers); quadrillage (population control)
- **Concessions:** Limited reforms proposed; De Gaulle eventually chose negotiated withdrawal; but settler and military resistance (OAS terrorism)
- **Counter-organization:** Harkis (Algerian auxiliary forces—~250,000); psychological warfare; villagization; but couldn't win "hearts and minds"

### Internal Dynamics

- **Cohesion vs. fragmentation:** FLN maintained external unity but internal violence severe; wilayas competed; purges and assassinations; Berber-Arab tensions; MNA rival faction destroyed by FLN
- **Internal conflicts:** Leadership struggles; regional commanders vs. external leadership; ideology (socialism, Islam, nationalism); tactics; resources; post-independence power grab
- **Leadership issues:** Original nine historic chiefs decimated; Ben Bella emerged through violence; authoritarianism; no democratic accountability; military (ALN) became dominant
- **Strategic debates:** Escalation vs. negotiation timing; urban vs. rural focus; civilian vs. military targets; socialism vs. nationalism; relations with France post-independence

## Outcomes

### Immediate

- **Policy changes:** Évian Accords (March 1962); independence (July 5, 1962); French withdrawal; but rights for pieds-noirs quickly violated
- **Regime changes:** FLN one-party state established; Ben Bella then Boumédiène (coup 1965); military-backed authoritarianism; French colonial administration ended
- **Concessions won:** Full independence; sovereignty; French military bases eventually closed; but massive human and economic cost
- **Repression faced:** 300,000-1.5 million Algerians killed (estimates vary); torture widespread; 2+ million displaced; tens of thousands of French soldiers killed; ~1 million pieds-noirs fled

### Long-term

- **Organizational legacies:** FLN remained ruling party until 2019 protests; military dominant in politics; authoritarian state; civil war (1990s) killed 200,000+; resistance tradition
- **Cultural/normative changes:** National independence narrative; martyrs cult; Arabic/Islam reasserted; French cultural influence contested; trauma and violence normalized
- **Unintended consequences:** Authoritarian one-party state; military dominance; economic development failures; civil war (1990s); harkis and pieds-noirs tragedies; France-Algeria relations poisoned
- **Lessons learned:** Armed resistance can win independence but at massive cost; violence produces authoritarianism; colonial settler states may require force; but long-term consequences severe

## Analysis

### What Worked

- **Successful elements:** Guerrilla warfare made French rule unsustainable; international solidarity (UN, Third World); De Gaulle's realism; French war weariness; FLN political mobilization
- **Why they worked:** France couldn't win militarily without unacceptable costs; metropolitan opinion turned; colonial era ending globally; Fourth Republic weak; De Gaulle chose withdrawal
- **Replicable factors:** Guerrilla warfare against overstretched colonial power; international solidarity; political mobilization; exploiting metropolitan political divisions

### What Didn't Work

- **Failures and mistakes:** Massive human cost; violence against civilians; internal FLN violence; economic destruction; produced authoritarian state; torture radicalized but also traumatized
- **Why they failed:** Violence spiral; FLN authoritarianism; no democratic foundations; economic devastation; revenge killings; military dominance inevitable after armed struggle
- **Avoidable vs. structural:** Some violence avoidable; but French settler colonialism and repression may have made nonviolent resistance impossible; authoritarianism perhaps avoidable with different choices

### Key Lessons

- **For similar contexts:** Armed resistance can defeat colonial powers with massive costs; settler colonialism especially violent; torture and collective punishment can radicalize population; international support crucial; but victory ≠ freedom or prosperity
- **For different contexts:** Success depended on French political crisis, decolonization context, FLN ruthlessness, external support; violence's costs (death, trauma, authoritarianism) severe; whether nonviolent alternative possible debated
- **Theoretical insights:** Violence can win independence but shape post-colonial state (militarized, authoritarian); armed movements tend toward authoritarianism; civilian targeting morally horrific and politically complex; comparison with India's nonviolent path crucial

### Unanswered Questions

- **Counterfactuals:** Could nonviolent resistance have worked (Gandhi visited, advocated satyagraha)? What if France had offered reforms earlier? What if FLN had been more democratic? What if OAS had succeeded?
- **Alternative strategies:** Was armed struggle inevitable given French settler colonialism? Could negotiations have happened earlier with less bloodshed? Different post-independence choices?
- **Debated interpretations:** Was violence necessary or could nonviolence have worked? How much responsibility to FLN vs. France for civilian deaths? Did independence justify costs? Was authoritarianism inevitable after armed struggle?
