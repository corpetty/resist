## Introduction

Previous essays examined mechanisms individually: [[Essay 1]] collective action, [[Essay 2]] power types, [[Essay 3]] violence, [[Essay 4]] information, [[Essay 5]] context, [[Essay 6]] victory theories, [[Essay 7]] organization. Now let's put it together: **what actually distinguishes movements that succeed from those that fail?**

Not individual factors but patterns—constellations of conditions that emerge from systematic comparison. This essay examines successful vs. failed cases to identify what separates victory from defeat.

## The Success Cases: What They Share

Compare our successful nonviolent transitions:

**[[Tunisian Revolution]] (2011):**
- Military refused to massacre, stayed neutral
- Homogeneous society (no sectarian divisions)
- Professional association organizational capacity (UGTT)
- Ben Ali internationally isolated
- Economic crisis motivating broad participation
- Rapid timeline (4 weeks) preventing counter-mobilization

**[[Polish Solidarity]] (1980-89):**
- Church provided sanctuary regime couldn't fully control
- Workplace organization giving economic leverage
- Gorbachev's non-intervention changing international context
- Elite negotiated transition offering acceptable exits
- Nine years building organizational resilience

**[[Velvet Revolution]] (1989):**
- Regime demoralized and divided
- Gorbachev signaling no Soviet intervention
- Civic Forum providing rapid coordination
- Six weeks moving decisively during window
- Military/security unwilling to massacre masses

**[[People Power Philippines]] (1986):**
- Military defection (Enrile/Ramos) decisive
- Church (Cardinal Sin) mobilizing millions
- Four-day speed preventing regime response
- US pressure on Marcos to leave
- Cross-class coalition in capital

**[[Indian Independence]] (1920s-1947):**
- Decades building organizational capacity (Congress)
- British exhausted post-WWII, international pressure
- Mass civil disobedience making governance impossible
- Economic leverage (boycotts, strikes)
- Negotiated transition when costs too high

**[[US Civil Rights Movement]] (1950s-60s):**
- Institutional infrastructure (churches, NAACP)
- Economic leverage (boycotts)
- Moral clarity constraining violence (somewhat)
- Federal system enabling intervention
- Media documentation building sympathy

**Patterns in success:**

1. **Security forces refused to massacre or defected** (Tunisia, Philippines, Velvet, Poland, East Germany)
2. **Organizational infrastructure sustained coordination** (all cases)
3. **Economic or administrative leverage** (Poland, Tunisia, India, US)
4. **International context favorable or constraining violence** (Poland/Velvet had Gorbachev; Tunisia/Philippines had Western pressure; US had federal intervention)
5. **Elite exits available** (negotiations in Poland, South Africa; flight in Tunisia; acceptance in Velvet)
6. **Broad coalitions** rather than narrow bases
7. **Strategic adaptation** to changing circumstances

Not every successful case had all factors—but each had several, and crucially, **lack of one could be compensated by strength in others**.

## The Failure Cases: What Went Wrong

Now examine failures to see what was missing:

**[[Tiananmen Square]] (1989):**
- Military willing to massacre (decisive difference from Velvet/Poland same year)
- No organizational infrastructure beyond universities
- Urban-rural divide preventing broader coalition
- International context (pre-1989 wave, no Gorbachev equivalent in China)
- No economic leverage over CCP
- Elite unified (hardliners won internal debates)

**Result:** Massacre, total defeat, decades of repression

**[[Syrian Uprising]] (2011-present):**
- Regime absolutely willing to use unlimited violence
- Sectarian divisions (Alawite vs. Sunni) exploitable
- Russia/Iran external backing decisive
- Armed resistance gave regime justification
- International intervention favored regime side
- Fragmented opposition couldn't coordinate

**Result:** Catastrophic civil war, 500,000+ dead, no positive outcome

**[[Hong Kong Protests]] (2019-2020):**
- Beijing absolutely determined to maintain control
- No military to defect (PLA wouldn't)
- Leaderless structure prevented strategic adaptation
- Economic leverage insufficient (China could absorb costs)
- International community rhetoric without action
- COVID-19 provided cover for National Security Law

**Result:** Total defeat, mass arrests, autonomy crushed

**[[Belarus 2020]] (2020-21):**
- Security forces remained loyal (well-paid, regime-dependent)
- Russia decisively backed Lukashenko
- Systematic torture deterred participation
- International community ineffective
- No economic crisis forcing elite fractures

**Result:** Brutal crushing, thousands tortured, movement destroyed

**[[Myanmar 2021]] (2021-present):**
- Military willing to use unlimited violence
- No international intervention (China/Thailand backing junta)
- Ethnic divisions complicating resistance
- Nonviolent resistance failed, armed resistance fragmented
- No economic leverage sufficient

**Result:** Ongoing civil war, thousands killed, military still in power

**[[Occupy Wall Street]] (2011):**
- No economic leverage over targets (financial sector)
- Leaderless structure prevented strategic coordination
- No demands regime could concede to
- Limited sustained participation despite broad sympathy
- Not facing repressive regime—democratic context with no clear victory condition

**Result:** Evicted, dissipated, minimal policy impact (though discourse shifted)

**Patterns in failure:**

1. **Military/security forces willing to massacre unlimited** (Tiananmen, Syria, Myanmar, Belarus)
2. **External backing for regime** (Syria, Belarus, Myanmar vs. Hong Kong's Beijing)
3. **No organizational infrastructure** or fragmented (Tiananmen, Occupy, Hong Kong, Syria)
4. **No economic/administrative leverage** (Occupy, Hong Kong)
5. **Sectarian/ethnic divisions** exploitable (Syria, Myanmar complications)
6. **International community indifferent** or backs regime (all cases)
7. **No elite exit options** acceptable to regime (Belarus, Myanmar, Hong Kong, Syria)

Again, not every failed case had all problems—but each lacked multiple success factors and faced multiple obstacles.

## The Difference Factors

Some factors appear decisive when comparing success vs. failure:

### Security Force Behavior (Most Decisive)

**Successes:** Tunisia military neutral, Philippines defection, Velvet/Poland/East Germany security unwilling to massacre

**Failures:** Tiananmen PLA massacred, Syria unlimited violence, Myanmar military brutal, Belarus torture

**Pattern:** When security forces will kill unlimited civilians, nonviolent resistance almost always fails. When they refuse or defect, regimes fall.

This factor is often outside movements' control—but movements can create conditions making massacre more costly (international attention, broad coalitions, nonviolent discipline).

### External Support/Pressure

**Successes:** Poland/Velvet had Gorbachev withdrawing support; Tunisia/Philippines had Western pressure; US Civil Rights had federal intervention

**Failures:** Syria had Russia/Iran; Belarus had Russia; Myanmar has China/Thailand; Hong Kong is Beijing; Tiananmen had no external constraint

**Pattern:** External backing makes regimes nearly invulnerable to domestic resistance. External pressure or withdrawal of support creates opportunities.

### Organizational Capacity

**Successes:** All had institutions (Churches in Poland/Philippines, UGTT in Tunisia, Congress in India, NAACP/churches in US, Civic Forum in Velvet)

**Failures:** Tiananmen lacked beyond universities; Occupy rejected organization; Hong Kong leaderless; Syria fragmented; Myanmar CDM amazing but insufficient vs. military

**Pattern:** Sustained campaigns require organizational capacity. Spontaneous energy dissipates without structure.

### Economic/Administrative Leverage

**Successes:** Poland strikes, Tunisia professional strikes, India civil disobedience, US boycotts all imposed costs

**Failures:** Occupy couldn't impose costs on Wall Street; Hong Kong insufficient economic leverage; Myanmar CDM paralyzed bureaucracy initially but military forced compliance; Syria/Belarus opposition lacked leverage

**Pattern:** Noncooperation requires leverage. Service economies, small movements, or contexts where regime can force compliance limit this mechanism.

## Cases That Complicate the Pattern

Some cases don't fit cleanly:

**[[Egyptian Revolution 2011]]:** Succeeded at removing Mubarak (mass protests, military refused to massacre) but failed at democratization (military coup 2013). Shows distinction between removing dictator vs. building democracy.

**[[Sudanese Revolution]] (2018-19):** Similar pattern—removed Bashir but military coup 2021, now civil war. Success at mobilization, failure at transition.

**[[Chilean Resistance to Pinochet]] (1973-90):** Succeeded eventually through plebiscite but took 17 years, combined armed resistance (counterproductive) with mass protests (more effective) and electoral strategy (decisive). Long timeline complicates success/failure binary.

**[[South African Anti-Apartheid]] (1950s-90s):** Succeeded at ending apartheid through negotiated transition, but economic justice incomplete. Partial victory.

**[[Iranian Revolution]] (1977-79):** Succeeded at overthrowing Shah but produced Islamic Republic more repressive than previous regime. Success at revolution, failure at achieving freedom.

**[[Serbian Otpor]] (1998-2000):** Succeeded at removing Milošević but Serbia's subsequent democratic consolidation rocky. Electoral strategy plus creative resistance worked, but messy after.

**[[Black Lives Matter]] (2013-present):** Massive mobilization, cultural impact, some policy wins, but structural change limited. Ongoing, hard to classify success/failure. Different goals (consciousness-raising vs. policy) make assessment complex.

**[[Thailand 2020 Protests]] (2020-21):** Broke monarchy criticism taboo (cultural success) but failed politically (military-monarchy alliance resilient). Lèse-majesté law effective deterrent.

These cases show:
- Removing dictators easier than building democracy
- Partial victories common (change some things, not others)
- Long timelines make assessment difficult
- Success/failure depends on which goals you prioritize

## What Doesn't Predict Outcomes (Surprising Negatives)

Some factors that seem important don't strongly predict success:

**Regime brutality:** Both successes (Poland had martial law, South Africa had apartheid) and failures (Belarus relatively "moderate" initially) had brutal repression. What matters is whether regime will massacre unlimited, not whether it's generally brutal.

**Movement size:** Occupy mobilized millions globally, failed. Velvet Revolution had hundreds of thousands in smaller country, succeeded. Size matters but isn't sufficient.

**Tactics creativity:** Hong Kong, Occupy, Thailand all used creative tactics. Didn't guarantee success. Tactics matter but context matters more ([[Essay 5]]).

**Democracy vs. authoritarianism:** Both democratic (Occupy in US) and authoritarian (Velvet in Czechoslovakia) contexts had movements. Success depends on specific regime vulnerabilities, not regime type alone.

**Economic development:** Both developed (Hong Kong) and developing (Tunisia) contexts had movements. Economic development doesn't predict success.

## Systematic Comparison: Chenoweth & Stephan Data

Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan's dataset (323 campaigns 1900-2006) found:

- Nonviolent campaigns succeeded 53% vs. violent campaigns 26%
- Success factors: participation breadth, security force defections, international support
- Nonviolent success predicted democratization; violent success predicted authoritarianism

Their findings match our patterns: broad participation (organizational capacity enables), security force behavior, external factors all decisive.

## Strategic Implications

Understanding success/failure patterns informs strategy:

**1. Assess whether victory is possible in your context.**

If regime will massacre unlimited + has external backing + security forces loyal + you lack organizational infrastructure/leverage → nonviolent resistance may not achieve victory in current conditions. Honest assessment prevents false hope.

**Myanmar 2021** and **Syria** show contexts where all factors aligned against success.

**2. Build organizational capacity early.**

Most successes had years/decades of organizing before decisive campaigns. [[US Civil Rights Movement]], [[Polish Solidarity]], [[Indian Independence]] all built capacity long before victory.

**3. Don't rely on single mechanism.**

[[Essay 6]]'s mechanisms—successful movements combine multiple. Hedge bets, create redundancy.

**4. Security force behavior is critical.**

Invest in making massacre costly: international attention, broad coalitions, nonviolent discipline, elite sympathizers within security forces.

**5. External factors often decisive but outside control.**

Position to exploit windows when they open (Gorbachev reforms, economic crises, international pressure). Can't create them, but can be ready.

**6. Distinguish removing dictators from achieving democracy.**

Egypt and Sudan show gap. Removing ruler is first step, not final victory. Need capacity to navigate transition ([[Essay 9]] examines this).

## Conclusion

Successful movements usually have:
- Security forces that won't massacre or defect
- Organizational infrastructure
- Economic or administrative leverage
- Favorable or constraining international context
- Broad coalitions
- Strategic flexibility

Failed movements usually lack multiple of these + face:
- Regimes willing to use unlimited violence
- External backing for autocrats
- Sectarian divisions
- No economic leverage
- International indifference

Not formulaic—context matters ([[Essay 5]]). But patterns exist. Understanding what separates success from failure enables reality-based strategy.

[[Essay 9]] examines ethical questions: even when resistance can win, should it? At what cost?
