## Introduction

[[Essay 1]] through [[Essay 5]] examined collective action problems, power types, violence traps, information asymmetries, and context dependency. But here's the question that actually matters: **when resistance wins, how does it win?**

Not tactics—[[Essay 5]] showed tactics are context-dependent. Not courage—many brave movements fail. The question is: what are the *mechanisms* through which resistance movements transform power relations?

This essay maps theories of victory: the different pathways through which movements achieve change, the conditions favoring each pathway, and why movements often combine multiple theories.

## Five Mechanisms of Change

Gene Sharp identified 198 nonviolent tactics. Useful taxonomy. But tactics serve strategies, and strategies assume theories of change. I see five primary mechanisms:

### 1. Conversion: Changing Opponents' Minds/Hearts

**Theory:** Demonstrations of moral clarity, nonviolent sacrifice, justice of cause convince opponents to change their position.

**Examples:** Some [[US Civil Rights Movement]] victories involved converting some white Southerners through moral witness. [[Gandhi]]'s fasts aimed partly at conversion—demonstrating commitment to principles would move British hearts/minds.

**When it works:** Rarely as primary mechanism. Requires:
- Shared moral framework between opponents
- Opponents with genuine decision-making authority
- Opponents' interests not fundamentally threatened

**Limitations:** [[Tiananmen Square]] students' hunger strike failed to convert CCP hardliners whose power was threatened. [[Syrian Uprising]] moral clarity didn't convert Assad, who saw existential threat. [[Hong Kong Protests]] couldn't convert Beijing through moral witness—no shared framework, fundamental interests at stake.

Conversion works marginally with third parties and some elites, rarely with core power-holders facing threats.

### 2. Accommodation: Negotiated Compromise

**Theory:** Sustained pressure convinces opponents that accommodation is preferable to continued conflict.

**Examples:** [[Polish Solidarity]] negotiated Round Table (1989) when regime concluded it couldn't govern without opposition cooperation. [[South African Anti-Apartheid]] ended via negotiations when NP calculated maintaining apartheid was more costly than transition.

**When it works:** Requires:
- Both sides conclude violence would be too costly
- Opponents see acceptable exit from conflict  
- Power balance shifts making compromise attractive
- External pressure or internal fractures creating incentives

[[Chilean Resistance to Pinochet]] succeeded through plebiscite—regime's own mechanism used to force transition. Pinochet calculated accepting defeat preferable to civil war given military's waning support.

**Limitations:** Requires opponents willing to negotiate. [[Myanmar 2021]] junta won't negotiate—sees no acceptable exit. [[Belarus 2020]] Lukashenko with Russia backing had no reason to compromise.

Accommodation produces imperfect outcomes—[[South African Anti-Apartheid]] ended apartheid but negotiated transition left economic inequality largely intact.

### 3. Noncooperation: System Paralysis Through Withdrawal

**Theory:** Withdraw cooperation regime depends on → system can't function → regime forced to concede or collapse.

**Examples:** the Montgomery Bus Boycott made segregated buses economically unviable. [[Polish Solidarity]] strikes shut down industries. [[Tunisian Revolution]] professional strikes and protests paralyzed government.

**When it works:** Requires:
- Clear leverage points (economic, administrative, social)
- Sustained participation
- Costs of noncooperation falling more on regime than movement
- No easy substitution (regime can't replace strikers easily)

[[Indian Independence]] mass civil disobedience made India ungovernable. British couldn't jail millions. Administrative collapse forced withdrawal.

**Limitations:** Requires masses can sustain withdrawal despite costs. [[Occupy Wall Street]] couldn't impose economic costs on targets—financial sector didn't depend on occupy participants' cooperation.

[[Myanmar 2021]] Civil Disobedience Movement paralyzed bureaucracy initially, but military brutality forced many back to work. Noncooperation works when regime depends on willing cooperation, not when it can force compliance at gunpoint.

### 4. Coercion: Imposing Unacceptable Costs

**Theory:** Impose costs (economic, political, reputational, military) until continuing current policy becomes untenable.

**Examples:** [[Anti-Apartheid]] international sanctions imposed costs on South African economy and regime legitimacy. [[Tunisian Revolution]] combined protests with strikes creating economic crisis for Ben Ali.

Violence is coercive mechanism—[[Algerian Independence]] FLN guerrilla war imposed military/economic costs on France until withdrawal became preferable.

**When it works:** Requires:
- Ability to impose meaningful costs
- Costs on regime exceed costs of conceding
- No external support offsetting costs
- Target has exit option (somewhere to concede to)

[[Serbian Otpor]] combined with international sanctions and domestic protests made Milošević continuation costly—military/elite calculated coup more acceptable than defending him.

**Limitations:** Requires leverage to impose costs. [[Hong Kong Protests]] couldn't impose costs Beijing cared about—no economic leverage sufficient, international pressure minimal, no military option.

Coercion often requires long timelines—costs accumulate slowly. [[Chilean Resistance to Pinochet]] 17 years before accumulated costs forced transition.

### 5. Disintegration: Regime Collapse From Within

**Theory:** Not converting opponents or imposing costs, but regime/opponents simply falling apart—elite defection, security force refusal, administrative breakdown, legitimacy evaporation.

**Examples:** [[Velvet Revolution]] and [[East German Revolution]] succeeded because regimes disintegrated. Security forces wouldn't repress, elites defected, Gorbachev wouldn't intervene, legitimacy gone.

[[People Power Philippines]] succeeded when military defected—regime disintegrated without functioning security apparatus.

**When it works:** Requires:
- Elite fractures
- Security force loyalty erosion
- Loss of external backing
- Cascading defections

Often fastest mechanism when it works—[[Velvet Revolution]] took six weeks because regime collapsed.

**Limitations:** Movements can't create disintegration, only exploit it. [[Tiananmen Square]] hoped for elite fractures that didn't materialize. [[Belarus 2020]] hoped security forces would defect—didn't happen.

Disintegration is contingent—depends on factors often outside movement control.

## Real Movements Combine Mechanisms

Actual victories rarely follow single mechanism. Most successful movements combine several:

**[[Indian Independence]]:**
- Conversion: Some British officials became sympathetic
- Accommodation: Negotiations produced independence
- Noncooperation: Mass civil disobedience made India ungovernable
- Coercion: WWII exhaustion and costs of holding India
- Disintegration: British Empire's legitimacy and capacity eroding globally

**[[Polish Solidarity]]:**
- Conversion: Some party members became sympathetic
- Accommodation: Round Table negotiations
- Noncooperation: Strikes and underground resistance
- Coercion: Economic crisis, international pressure
- Disintegration: Communist Party's loss of confidence, Gorbachev's withdrawal

**[[Tunisian Revolution]]:**
- Accommodation: (Limited) Some concessions before Ben Ali fled
- Noncooperation: Professional strikes, protests
- Coercion: Economic crisis
- Disintegration: Ben Ali fled, military refused to defend him

**[[South African Anti-Apartheid]]:**
- Conversion: International anti-apartheid movement
- Accommodation: Negotiated transition
- Noncooperation: Boycotts, strikes
- Coercion: Sanctions, armed struggle (limited), ungovernability
- Disintegration: NP elite concluded apartheid unsustainable

Movements that succeed usually work multiple mechanisms simultaneously—creating redundancy and compounding pressure.

## Implications for Strategy

Understanding victory mechanisms shapes strategy:

**1. Diagnose which mechanisms are possible in your context.**

[[Hong Kong Protests]]: Conversion (Beijing)—impossible. Accommodation—Beijing refused. Noncooperation—limited leverage. Coercion—couldn't impose meaningful costs. Disintegration—Beijing not fracturing.

This diagnosis might have led to different strategies—or recognition that victory in traditional sense wasn't achievable without international intervention that wouldn't come.

**2. Build capacity for multiple mechanisms.**

Don't rely on single pathway. [[Polish Solidarity]] combined workplace organizing (noncooperation), underground culture (maintaining legitimacy), negotiations (accommodation), international solidarity (coercion), and exploited USSR's crisis (disintegration).

**3. Sequence mechanisms strategically.**

Early: noncooperation and coercion to create crisis.
Middle: exploit elite fractures (disintegration).
Late: accommodation through negotiation.

**4. Recognize victory is usually negotiated, not total.**

[[Essay 3]] noted violent victories often produce authoritarian outcomes. Nonviolent victories usually produce negotiated transitions—which means compromises.

[[South African Anti-Apartheid]] ended apartheid but economic justice incomplete. [[Chilean Resistance to Pinochet]] achieved democracy but Pinochet remained army commander, constitution persisted for decades. [[Polish Solidarity]] negotiated transition that preserved some communist elite positions.

Total victory is rare. Understanding accommodation mechanism accepts this reality.

**5. External factors often decisive.**

[[Velvet Revolution]], [[Polish Solidarity]], [[East German Revolution]] all succeeded partly because Gorbachev removed Soviet support. [[Tunisian Revolution]] succeeded partly because France/US didn't defend Ben Ali. [[People Power Philippines]] succeeded partly because US pressured Marcos to leave.

Movements can't control these factors, but should recognize their importance and position to exploit them when they shift.

## When All Mechanisms Fail

Some contexts offer no viable victory mechanism:

[[Myanmar 2021]]: Military won't negotiate, can coerce population, has Chinese/Russian backing, isn't disintegrating, can't be converted.

[[Syrian Uprising]]: Assad ruthless, Russia/Iran backing, opposition fragmented, military loyal, international intervention favoring regime.

[[Belarus 2020]]: Lukashenko has Russia backing, security forces loyal, torture works for coercion, won't accommodate.

In these contexts, movements face tragic choices: accept oppression, continue resistance knowing victory unlikely (maintaining dignity/culture), wait for external factors to change (regime succession, geopolitical shifts), or accept that nonviolent resistance has limits in face of unlimited brutality backed externally.

This isn't defeatism—it's realism. Understanding when nonviolent resistance can't win in current conditions informs whether to:
- Shift to preservation/survival mode
- Look for longer timelines
- Accept that some tyrannies can't be overcome by domestic resistance alone

Honesty about mechanisms of victory prevents false hope and wasted effort pursuing impossible strategies.

## Conclusion

Resistance wins through converting opponents, accommodating with them, withdrawing cooperation they need, imposing costs they can't sustain, or exploiting their disintegration. Usually combinations.

Understanding which mechanisms are possible in your context, building capacity for multiple pathways, and recognizing external factors' roles is essential for reality-based strategy.

[[Essay 7]] examines how organization and leadership shape movements' capacity to pursue these victory mechanisms.
