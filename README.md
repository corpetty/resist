# Resistance Theory Project - Documentation

## Overview

This collection of documents provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing resistance movements, understanding their dynamics, and developing strategic thinking about social change. The project emerged from exploring the fundamental tension: non-violent resistance requires solving difficult collective action problems, while violence offers accessible individual agency but usually fails strategically.

## Document Guide

### Core Framework
**File:** `resistance_framework.md`

The foundational analytical framework covering:
- Four core dimensions for analyzing any resistance movement
- Taxonomy of resistance types (high/low coordination × high/low violence)
- Conditions for individual non-violent effectiveness
- Critical questions for strategic analysis
- Contemporary complications (digital, globalization, polarization)
- Historical patterns of success and failure
- Key tensions and paradoxes
- Strategic principles

**Use this for:** Understanding the theoretical foundation, analyzing specific movements, developing strategic thinking

### Research Guide
**File:** `research_questions.md`

100 research questions organized by theme:
- Meta-questions about resistance
- Collective action mechanics
- State response and counter-resistance
- Violence and non-violence
- Technology and media
- Specific tactics
- Demographics and identity
- Ideological frameworks
- Organizational forms

- **Diverse:** Different tactics, contexts, outcomes
- **Comprehensive:** Violent and non-violent, successful and failed

### Quality Standards
- **Well-researched:** Multiple sources, primary and secondary
- **Carefully argued:** Clear claims, supporting evidence
- **Accessible:** Jargon-free where possible, explained where necessary
- **Honest about limits:** Acknowledge uncertainty and debate
- **Open to revision:** Living documents, not final word

## Philosophy

This project emerges from the conviction that:

1. **Resistance is difficult** - Power doesn't concede easily, and we should be honest about that
2. **Context matters enormously** - Universal prescriptions are suspect
3. **Strategy requires analysis** - Passion and commitment aren't enough
4. **History offers lessons** - But only if we study it carefully
5. **Moral seriousness is strategic** - Not naive idealism
6. **Collective action remains necessary** - Despite its challenges
7. **Understanding helps** - Even if it doesn't guarantee success

The work continues.
