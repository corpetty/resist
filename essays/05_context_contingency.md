# Context and Contingency: Why History Doesn't Repeat (Lessons Transfer Badly)

## Introduction

After [[Tunisian Revolution]] succeeded in January 2011, activists across the Middle East thought they'd found a formula. Organize via social media, occupy central squares, maintain nonviolent discipline, demand democratic change. It worked in Tunisia—why not everywhere?

[[Egyptian Revolution 2011]] seemed to validate this: Tahrir Square occupation, Mubarak fell, democracy incoming. Then everything diverged. Egypt's military coup. [[Syrian Uprising]] descent into civil war. [[Bahrain Uprising]] crushed with Saudi tanks. [[Yemen Uprising]] producing ongoing catastrophe.

Same tactics, similar demographics (youth-led, social media coordinated, Middle Eastern autocracies), completely different outcomes. Why?

Because **context matters more than tactics**. The specific constellation of factors in Tunisia—military neutrality, homogeneous society, small state size, professional class organization, Ben Ali's isolation—didn't exist elsewhere. Tactics that worked in that context failed catastrophically in others.

This essay examines why resistance strategies are profoundly context-dependent, how contingent factors shape outcomes as much as tactics, and why drawing lessons across cases is harder than it appears.

## The Tunisia Example: Why Did It Work?

[[Tunisian Revolution]] succeeded because of context convergence:

**Military professionalism:** Tunisian military had no business interests, limited political role, professional ethos. When protests erupted, military refused to massacre civilians. Not because generals were democratic heroes—because institutional structure didn't give them interest in protecting Ben Ali.

Compare [[Egypt]]: military had vast business empire, saw itself as guardian of state. Initially tolerated protests to remove Mubarak (who threatened their interests via family succession), but then hijacked transition to protect institutional power. Same "nonviolent uprising removes dictator" story, radically different outcome because of military's structural position.

**Social homogeneity:** Tunisia is 99% Sunni Muslim, ethnically Arab with Berber minority. No sectarian divisions for regime to exploit. When economic grievances united people, they actually united.

[[Syria]]: Alawite-dominated regime, Sunni majority, Kurdish minority, Christian minority. Assad exploited sectarian fears—Sunnis would massacre Alawites if regime fell. This fractured opposition along identity lines violence intensified. Tactics couldn't overcome structural sectarianism.

**Small state size:** Tunisia (12 million people) meant protests in capital mattered more. Economic pressure concentrated. Information traveled faster. Coordination easier.

[[Syria]]: 23 million, geographically larger, more rural. Damascus protests didn't paralyze whole country. Regime could mobilize Alawite base, rural populations, crush urban protests piecemeal.

**Professional class organization:** Tunisian Professionals Association (doctors, lawyers, teachers) provided organizational capacity for coordinating strikes that nonviolent protests alone wouldn't achieve.

[[Egypt]]: Professional class less organized, labor unions state-controlled. Workers joined protests but organizational infrastructure weaker. After Mubarak fell, no institutions to contest military.

**Ben Ali isolation:** Ben Ali was international pariah with France/US relationship but not deep backing. Once he seemed vulnerable, France/US didn't protect him.

[[Bahrain]]: Monarchy had deep Saudi/GCC backing. When protests threatened regime, Saudi Arabia sent tanks. External support made regime unshakeable by domestic protests alone.

**Timing and demonstration effects:** Tunisia went first, surprising everyone including Ben Ali. Later uprisings faced regimes learning from Tunisia—more prepared, less likely to flee.

This constellation was specific. Trying to replicate "the Tunisian model" elsewhere meant importing tactics into radically different contexts.

## Structural Factors That Shape Outcomes

Let's systematize what context means:

**Regime type and capacity:**
- [[Belarus 2020]]: Lukashenko had KGB, riot police, Russia backing. Strong enough to torture thousands and ride out protests.
- [[Velvet Revolution]]: Czechoslovak Communist Party demoralized, Gorbachev withdrawing support, security apparatus unwilling to repress en masse.

Same tactic (mass protests) intersected different regime capacities producing different outcomes.

**Elite cohesion/fracture:**
- [[People Power Philippines]]: Military defection removed Marcos's enforcement tool.
- [[Tiananmen Square]]: PLA despite some officer reluctance ultimately followed orders to massacre.

Whether elites split determines whether protests can succeed. Movements can't create splits, only exploit them.

**Geopolitical context:**
- [[Velvet Revolution]], [[Polish Solidarity]], [[East German Revolution]]: Gorbachev's non-intervention meant 1989 uprisings succeeded.
- [[Hungarian Revolution 1956]]: Soviet tanks crushed it. Same geography, different Soviet policy, different outcome.

- [[Hong Kong Protests]]: Beijing's determination to maintain control plus international unwillingness to confront China meant tactics that worked elsewhere couldn't work there.

**Economic structures:**
- [[Polish Solidarity]]: Industrial workers in centrally-planned economy had strike leverage. Shutting down shipyards, mines mattered.
- [[Occupy Wall Street]]: Service economy, financialization, geographic dispersal meant protesters couldn't impose economic costs on targets.

Economic leverage depends on economic structure.

**Social composition:**
- [[US Civil Rights Movement]]: Southern Black churches provided organizational infrastructure, social accountability, leadership. Specific to African-American historical experience.
- [[Black Lives Matter]]: Decentralized, no dominant institutions, social media coordination. Reflected different generational/organizational context.

Same issue (racism, police violence), different social structures available for mobilization.

**Cultural/historical context:**
- [[Indian Independence]]: Ahimsa (nonviolence) in Hindu/Jain tradition provided cultural resources for Gandhi's satyagraha. Context-specific.
- [[Algerian Independence]]: FLN framed resistance as armed anti-colonial struggle echoing prior resistance. Cultural expectation shaped tactic choice.

## Contingent Factors: Luck and Timing

Beyond structural context, contingent events shape outcomes:

**Individual decisions:**
- [[People Power Philippines]]: If Enrile/Ramos hadn't defected, probably failed.
- [[Velvet Revolution]]: If security forces had shot into crowds November 17, could have crushed movement early.

These weren't predetermined by structure. Individuals made choices that could have gone differently.

**Accidents and provocations:**
- [[Tunisian Revolution]]: Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation wasn't planned uprising launch—but became one. Contingent event creating political moment.
- [[Hong Kong Protests]]: Extradition bill that sparked protests was legislative accident regime didn't anticipate would produce mass mobilization.

**Timing:**
- [[Velvet Revolution]]: Happening during Berlin Wall fall created regional momentum. Six weeks earlier or later, different context.
- [[Belarus 2020]]: COVID-19 both enabled (economic frustration) and constrained (restrictions on gathering) resistance.

**International events:**
- [[Syrian Uprising]]: Libya intervention (NATO backed rebels) created expectation of similar support in Syria. When support didn't materialize, affected strategic calculations.
- [[Hong Kong Protests]]: Trump administration ambivalence vs. clear US opposition might have changed Beijing's calculus.

These factors aren't predictable or replicable.

## Why Lessons Transfer Badly

Activists trying to learn from successful cases face several problems:

**Selection bias:** We study successes, not failures. But failures outnumber successes—most resistance movements fail. Studying only successes creates illusion that tactics caused victory when context mattered more.

[[Serbian Otpor]] is studied as color revolution model. But dozens of movements used similar tactics and failed because they lacked Serbia's specific context (Milošević isolation, economic crisis, elite fractures, NATO pressure).

**Survivorship bias:** Successful tactics in one context might have failed in slightly different circumstances—we just don't see alternate histories.

[[Gandhi]] is celebrated for nonviolent success. But British Empire in 1940s was exhausted from WWII, facing decolonization pressure, constrained by international opinion. Gandhi in 1840s British Empire—during height of imperial confidence—likely would have failed. We don't run that experiment.

**Context invisibility:** Structural factors are often invisible to participants and observers. They notice tactics (visible) but not underlying conditions (invisible) that made tactics work.

[[Tunisian Revolution]] activists saw: social media coordination, professional organization, nonviolent discipline. Didn't necessarily see: military's institutional independence, state's small size, Ben Ali's isolation, homogeneous society. Tried to replicate visible tactics without invisible context.

**Overgeneralization:** Drawing universal lessons from specific cases ignores context dependency.

Gene Sharp's *From Dictatorship to Democracy* synthesizes nonviolent tactics from many cases. Valuable framework. But treating it as universal manual ignores that tactics work differently in different contexts. What worked in [[Poland]] (Catholic Church sanctuary) doesn't exist in China. What worked in [[Tunisia]] (military neutrality) didn't exist in [[Syria]].

## Transferable vs. Context-Specific Elements

Not everything is context-dependent. Some principles generalize:

**Broadly transferable:**
- Nonviolent discipline reduces regime's legitimacy to repress violently (though doesn't eliminate repression)
- Broad coalitions more powerful than narrow ones
- Elite defection enables transitions
- International pressure constrains some regimes (not all)
- Organization and infrastructure matter more than spontaneous energy
- Movements need both vision and practical demands

These principles hold across contexts—but their specific implementation is always context-dependent.

**Context-specific:**
- Which tactics impose costs on regime
- What organizational infrastructure is available
- Whether violence or nonviolence is more effective
- How much international pressure matters
- What coalition is possible
- How long campaigns can sustain

These must be figured out case-by-case.

## Strategic Thinking Across Contexts

Given this, how should movements approach strategy?

**1. Analyze your specific context ruthlessly.**

[[Hong Kong Protests]] couldn't change that Beijing was determined to control Hong Kong, international community wouldn't confront China, no military to defect. Understanding these constraints earlier might have led to different strategic choices (not necessarily successful—context was brutally unfavorable—but at least reality-based).

**2. Learn principles, not tactics.**

From [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], learn: economic leverage through concentrated withdrawal of participation, sustaining coordination through institutional infrastructure (churches), translating grievance into organized campaign.

Don't learn: organize bus boycott (that was specific tactic in specific context).

**3. Test tactics in your context.**

[[Serbian Otpor]] graffiti and stickers worked in Serbia's context. Movements elsewhere copied without testing whether similar tactics would work in their specific context (different regime responses, different cultural meanings, different coordination challenges).

**4. Build capacity to adapt.**

[[Polish Solidarity]] survived because it could adapt strategies to changing context: public organizing → underground resistance → negotiations. Rigid commitment to tactics that worked initially would have failed when context changed (martial law).

**5. Accept contingency.**

Some outcomes depend on contingent factors outside control. [[Velvet Revolution]] succeeded partly because Gorbachev was reforming USSR. Nothing Czechoslovak protesters did created that—they just exploited the window it opened.

Movements can't control geopolitics, individual decisions by regime elites, or timing. Strategic planning must account for contingency, not assume control over all variables.

## Conclusion

Resistance movements want formulas: do X, Y, Z → achieve democratic change. Understandable desire, especially when people are suffering under oppression.

But history doesn't offer formulas. It offers case studies showing how specific tactics intersected specific contexts producing specific outcomes—many contingent on unpredictable factors.

This doesn't mean strategy is impossible or lessons useless. It means:
- Tactics must fit context
- Structural factors often matter more than tactics
- Contingency plays larger role than we want to admit
- Humility about predictions is essential
