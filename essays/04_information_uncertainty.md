# Information and Uncertainty: What Movements Know and When They Know It

## Introduction

[[Essay 1]] showed how collective action requires coordination. [[Essay 2]] examined who has leverage. [[Essay 3]] explored violence's costs. Now we confront a problem underlying all resistance strategy: **operating under radical uncertainty about crucial facts.**

When should you escalate? Is the regime about to collapse or dig in? Will security forces defect or massacre? Are international powers preparing intervention or just issuing statements? Will tomorrow's protest draw dozens or millions?

Movements must make high-stakes decisions with incomplete, often deliberately obscured information. This isn't just difficult—it fundamentally shapes what tactics are possible and which strategies make sense.

## The Information Asymmetry

Regimes have systematic information advantages:

**Internal intelligence:** Security services monitor movements through infiltration, surveillance, informants. [[Tiananmen Square]] leaders didn't know Chinese Communist Party internal debates (hardliners vs. reformers). Students couldn't see military units positioning around Beijing. CCP leadership knew the movement's internal divisions,

leaders' identities, plans.

Protesters knew none of this about the regime.

**Control of media:** Authoritarian states shape information environments. [[Myanmar 2021]] junta controlled state television, imposed internet blackouts, arrested journalists. Resistance relied on Facebook and VPNs, but regime controlled information to military/rural populations.

**Resource for research:** States can fund intelligence gathering at scales movements can't match. They know economic vulnerabilities, coalition fractures, international positioning.

Movements operate asymmetrically blind. This affects everything.

## What Movements Can't Know (But Need To)

**Regime cohesion:** Is the elite united or fracturing? [[Velvet Revolution]] succeeded partly because Czechoslovak Communist Party was demoralized and divided by 1989. Protesters couldn't know this with certainty until defection happened.

Compare [[Belarus 2020]], where Lukashenko's elite remained unified. Protesters hoped for fractures that never came. By the time this was clear, movement had already mobilized resources.

**Security force loyalty:** Will police/military obey orders to shoot?

[[People Power Philippines]] succeeded because military defectors (Enrile, Ramos) took units with them. But protesters couldn't know in advance that crucial military figures would defect. They massed on EDSA praying soldiers wouldn't fire—and got lucky.

[[Tiananmen Square]] protesters thought soldiers were fellow citizens who'd refuse massacre orders. They were catastrophically wrong. [[Syrian Uprising]] peaceful protesters thought regime violence would delegitimize Assad and force change. Also wrong—it escalated.

You can't know what soldiers will do until the moment. This uncertainty is strategic nightmare.

**International intentions:** Will foreign powers intervene?

[[Hong Kong Protests]] couldn't know whether US/UK would impose meaningful costs on China or just make statements. (Answer: mostly statements.) Hope for international pressure sustained protests, but protests ended without it materializing significantly.

[[Belarus 2020]] hoped EU pressure would force Lukashenko to negotiate. Russia's decisive backing proved more important. Protesters couldn't know this balance in advance.

**Critical mass:** How many people will actually show up?

Before [[Tunisian Revolution]]'s Mohamed Bouazizi protest in Sidi Bouzid, organizers couldn't know it would spread nationwide. Before [[Egyptian Revolution 2011]]'s January 25, organizers hoped for large turnout but couldn't guarantee it. Success depended on crossing thresholds unknowable in advance.

[[Occupy Wall Street]] activists hoped mass participation would sustain camps. It didn't materialize at needed scales. But they couldn't know this beforehand.

**Timing windows:** When is the moment for escalation?

[[Velvet Revolution]] moved decisively in six weeks (November 1989). [[Polish Solidarity]] knew to push in 1989 when Gorbachev signaled non-intervention, but too early (1981-88) and they'd have been crushed worse.

Movements must sense when conditions align—regime weak, people ready, international context favorable. But this requires information often unavailable.

## How Movements Reduce Uncertainty

Despite these limitations, successful movements develop information strategies:

**Signals and tests:** Small actions to gauge regime response, popular support, elite fractures.

[[Serbian Otpor]] used graffiti and stickers—low-risk actions testing how many people would participate and how regime would respond. Gradually escalated based on evidence.

[[US Civil Rights Movement]] Freedom Rides tested federal willingness to protect interstate travelers. Sit-ins tested business owners' responses. Each action provided information for scaling strategy.

**Insider intelligence:** Sympathetic defectors, whistleblowers, moles provide regime information.

[[Polish Solidarity]] had sympathizers within party and security services providing warnings. Not perfect information, but better than nothing.

[[Tunisian Revolution]] benefited from WikiLeaks cables revealing Ben Ali corruption, confirming what activists suspected but now had proof of.

**Building distributed intelligence:** Large movements collect information from many sources.

[[Sudanese Revolution]]'s resistance committees across Khartoum neighborhoods shared information about regime deployment, violence, popular mood. Aggregating distributed observations reduced uncertainty.

**Probing attacks:** Actions designed more to reveal information than achieve direct goals.

When [[Hong Kong Protests]] tested different tactics (marches, airport occupation, university defense), they learned what imposed costs on Beijing and what provoked crackdowns. Information gathering through action.

**Network effects:** Once protests begin, subsequent actions reveal information.

[[Tunisian Revolution]] and [[Egyptian Revolution 2011]] early protests provided evidence about participation levels, regime response, international attention. Each day's protests revealed more, enabling real-time strategy adjustments.

## The Fog of Resistance

Military theory has "fog of war"—information uncertainty during battle. Resistance movements face "fog of resistance":

**Can't distinguish regime weakness from strategic patience:** Is the regime weakening or conserving strength for decisive crackdown?

[[Syria Uprising]] misread Assad's initial restraint as weakness. Turned out to be regrouping for devastating response.

**Can't distinguish popular fatigue from strategic pause:** Are people exhausted or gathering energy?

[[Chilean Resistance to Pinochet]] ebbed and flowed over 17 years. Hard to distinguish exhaustion from tactical regrouping during quiet periods.

**Can't distinguish international sympathy from meaningful support:** Do foreign statements matter?

[[Hong Kong Protests]] received international statements of support—but no meaningful material consequences for China. Protesters couldn't know in advance that support would be rhetorical only.

**Can't distinguish regime concessions from tactical delays:** Is compromise genuine or buying time?

[[Myanmar 2021]] NUG negotiated with ASEAN. Hard to tell if engagement was meaningful or allowing junta to consolidate.

These uncertainties create strategic dilemmas with no clear resolution.

## Information and Tactic Choice

Uncertainty about regime response shapes what tactics are viable:

**Nonviolent tactics create information** [[Essay 1]] noted mass protests require coordination. But they also *reveal* information: how many will participate, regime response, international reaction, security force behavior.

First protest in a campaign is inherently uncertain. If it succeeds (large turnout, regime doesn't massacre), subsequent protests become lower risk. If it fails (small turnout or brutal repression), information informs strategy adjustment.

[[Tunisian Revolution]] and [[Egyptian Revolution 2011]] early successes revealed information that enabled escalation.

**Violence obscures information:** [[Essay 3]] examined violence's costs. Additional problem: violence makes it harder to distinguish regime reactions.

If peaceful protest is repressed, you learn: regime fears movement, is willing to repress peaceful dissent, may be losing legitimacy (having to shoot unarmed protesters).

If armed uprising is repressed, you learn much less. Regime is defending itself against armed threat—normal state function. Doesn't reveal underlying strength/weakness as clearly.

**Gradual escalation as information gathering:** Successful movements often escalate gradually, learning at each stage.

[[Polish Solidarity]] went from workplace activism (1970s) → strikes (1980) → national movement (1980-81) → underground resistance (1981-89) → negotiated transition (1989). Each phase revealed information enabling next phase.

Contrast [[Tiananmen Square]], which escalated rapidly from protests → occupation → hunger strike → declaration without the information-gathering phases that might have revealed regime's determination to violently suppress.

## Digital Age Information Dynamics

Technology radically changes information asymmetries:

**Surveillance advantages:** Regimes monitor digital communications. [[Hong Kong Protests]] sophisticated operational security couldn't fully protect against surveillance. [[Belarus 2020]] Telegram Nexta channel coordinated millions but also provided regime database of participants.

**Coordination advantages:** Social media enables rapid mobilization. [[Tunisian Revolution]], [[Egyptian Revolution 2011]], [[Hong Kong Protests]] mobilized faster than pre-digital movements because information spread instantly.

**Documentation capabilities:** Cell phone videos provide evidence. [[Myanmar 2021]] coup brutality was documented extensively. [[Black Lives Matter]] George Floyd murder video was decisive in galvanizing protest. Information democratization.

**Disinformation vulnerabilities:** Regimes can flood information space. [[Syria Uprising]] faced massive disinformation from regime and external actors. Hard to distinguish truth from propaganda.

**Echo chambers:** Social media algorithms create false confidence through reinforcement. [[Occupy Wall Street]] online engagement didn't translate to sustained participation—but algorithmic amplification of sympathetic content created illusion of broader support.

Net effect: Technology speeds information flow but doesn't eliminate fundamental asymmetries. In some ways, makes information environment more confusing.

## Strategic Implications

Operating under uncertainty requires:

**1. Humility about predictions:** Acknowledge you don't know crucial facts.

[[Hong Kong Protests]] couldn't predict Beijing's patience or eventual crackdown timing. [[Belarus 2020]] couldn't predict Russia's backing level. Movements that recognize uncertainty can pivot when predictions prove wrong.

**2. Robust strategies:** Choose tactics that work across multiple scenarios rather than depending on specific unknowns.

Nonviolent discipline makes sense even if you don't know whether security forces will defect—either they defect (you win) or they face moral dilemma of shooting peaceful protesters (constrains violence, builds sympathy).

**3. Information gathering as explicit goal:** Design some actions primarily to reveal information rather than achieve immediate goals.

**4. Distributed intelligence:** Large networks can aggregate information regimes can't fully control. [[Sudanese Revolution]] resistance committees, [[Polish Solidarity]] workplace networks, [[Hong Kong Protests]] decentralized coordination all built distributed intelligence capacity.

**5. Flexible planning:** Strategies must adapt to revealed information. Rigid plans fail when reality diverges from assumptions.

[[Velvet Revolution]] succeeded partly through rapid tactical adjustments based on information (regime fracturing, Gorbachev not intervening, people ready to mobilize). [[Tiananmen Square]] rigidity prevented adaptation when information showed regime preparing crackdown.

## When Uncertainty Matters Most

Information asymmetries are particularly consequential at:

**Escalation points:** Deciding whether to intensify or pause based on incomplete information about regime strength, popular support, international context.

**Crises:** When unexpected events create windows (regime scandal, economic collapse, international incident). Movements must decide quickly with partial information.

**Transitions:** After initial victory (dictator falls, regime concedes), information about military intentions, elite negotiations, international positions becomes critical. [[Egyptian Revolution 2011]] and [[Sudanese Revolution]] couldn't know military would hijack transitions until too late to prevent.

## Conclusion

Resistance movements are not military campaigns where both sides know rules and objectives. They're operating blind through fundamentally uncertain political terrains, making high-stakes choices with partial information, facing opponents with systematic intelligence advantages.

This doesn't make resistance impossible—obviously movements sometimes succeed despite information asymmetries. But it means strategies must account for uncertainty explicitly. Robust approaches, information gathering, flexibility, and humility about predictions are essential.

[[Essay 5]] examines how context and contingency shape which strategies can work—because even perfect information about your context doesn't tell you how history will unfold.
