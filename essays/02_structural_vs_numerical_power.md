# When One Person Can Matter: Structural Power vs. Numerical Power

## Introduction

[[Essay 1]] established that mass resistance faces brutal collective action problems. You need thousands of people to coordinate risky action with uncertain payoffs. This is why individual acts of defiance—however courageous—usually accomplish nothing.

But that's not always true.

On June 3, 2013, Edward Snowden leaked classified NSA documents revealing mass surveillance programs. One person. One act. Global impact. Contrast this with [[Occupy Wall Street]], which mobilized tens of thousands across hundreds of cities for months—and achieved basically nothing structurally.

What gives?

The answer is the difference between **numerical power** (strength in numbers) and **structural power** (leverage through position). Most resistance theory focuses on numerical power because most people don't have structural leverage. But understanding both is essential for strategic thinking about change.

This essay examines when individual acts matter, why those opportunities aren't equally distributed, and what this means for movements dependent on mass coordination.

## Two Types of Power

Think of power as flowing through systems like electricity through circuits. Numerical power is like voltage—increasing numbers increases force. Structural power is like finding the circuit breaker—one person in the right place can shut the whole thing down.

**Numerical power** depends on scale. The [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] worked because tens of thousands of Black residents stopped riding buses simultaneously for 381 days. Remove half the participants and the boycott fails—buses would still run profitably. The power came from mass withdrawal of compliance.

**Structural power** depends on position. One person occupying a critical node in a system can have disproportionate impact regardless of numbers. A power plant worker turning off the grid. A judge issuing a ruling. A general refusing an order. A programmer sabotaging code.

Most people have little structural leverage. Most systems are designed specifically to prevent individual actors from having too much control—redundancy, oversight, replaceability. This is why resistance usually requires mass coordination: because most of us lack individual leverage, we need numbers.

But certain positions do confer leverage. Understanding these is strategically valuable even if you don't occupy them—because movements can sometimes create or exploit structural positions.

## Sources of Individual Leverage

**Positional power in critical systems:** Some people occupy positions where their compliance or defection significantly affects system operation. Not because they're special, but because of where they sit in the structure.

[[People Power Philippines]] succeeded partly because Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel Ramos defected from Marcos, taking military units with them. Two individuals, positioned at critical nodes in the security apparatus, made the regime militarily untenable. Millions of civilians on EDSA provided moral pressure and physical protection, but the military defection was structurally decisive.

Compare [[Myanmar 2021]], where critical military and police leaders remained loyal to the junta despite millions protesting. The Civil Disobedience Movement included thousands of civil servants withdrawing cooperation—teachers, doctors, railway workers refusing to work for the military government. This created administrative chaos and denied legitimacy. Yet without military defection, the regime retained enforcement capacity to crush resistance.

The structural difference: in Philippines, key military officers defected. In Myanmar, they didn't. One explanation for different outcomes.

**Information asymmetry:** Whistleblowers leverage access to information others lack. Edward Snowden revealed NSA surveillance. Daniel Ellsberg leaked Pentagon Papers on Vietnam War lies. Chelsea Manning exposed military misconduct.

These individuals had positional access to information, understood its significance, and chose to make it public at enormous personal cost. The leaked information itself didn't overthrow governments—but it shifted public understanding, enabled legal challenges, constrained future abuse.

Crucially, whistleblowers still depend on collective response. Snowden's revelations mattered because journalists amplified them, advocacy groups mobilized around them, some officials responded. Without that collective infrastructure, leaks disappear into noise.

**Credibility and expertise:** Specialists in technical or scientific fields can leverage institutional authority for resistance. Physicians documenting torture. Scientists revealing environmental violations. Economists exposing corruption. Lawyers challenging constitutionality.

[[Chilean Resistance to Pinochet]] included doctors and lawyers documenting human rights violations through the Vicariate of Solidarity. Their professional credibility made documentation credible internationally, creating external pressure. Individual doctors examining torture victims couldn't overthrow Pinochet—but their testimony contributed to international isolation and eventual transition.

**Platform access:** Some individuals have platforms (media, institutional positions, public visibility) that amplify their voice beyond their numerical contribution.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s individual speeches and writings had outsized impact in the [[US Civil Rights Movement]]—not because he was the movement, but because he occupied platforms (pulpits, media access, Nobel Prize) that amplified the movement's message. His assassination demonstrated both the power and vulnerability of highly visible individuals.

Václav Havel leveraged his status as prominent playwright-dissident in [[Velvet Revolution]] to speak for the opposition. His public credibility helped unite disparate groups and negotiate with regime. But he couldn't have created the revolution alone—his individual platform mattered because millions of people were ready to act.

**Moral extremity:** Acts of extreme self-sacrifice can create political crises that ripple systemically. Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in Tunisia sparked the [[Tunisian Revolution]]—not because burning yourself is politically effective (it usually isn't), but because his act crystallized widespread frustrations into a political moment.

These acts work when they resonate with existing collective anger and organizational capacity. Bouazizi's death mattered because Tunisian Professional Association and resistance networks could channel outrage into sustained action. Self-immolations happen in many contexts without sparking revolutions—the difference is whether infrastructure exists to convert individual sacrifice into collective mobilization.

Rosa Parks wasn't the first Black woman arrested for refusing segregated seating. She was chosen by [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] organizers because her character made her a sympathetic case and because organizational infrastructure existed to build around her arrest. The individual act mattered because of collective readiness.

## The Catch: Access and Opportunity

Here's the problem: structural leverage positions aren't equally accessible. They're distributed by existing power structures—often specifically to people loyal to those structures.

**Class and education:** Whistleblowers like Snowden, Ellsberg, Manning had access to classified information because of jobs requiring security clearances, which require backgrounds checks and educational credentials disproportionately accessible to middle/upper class. The structurally powerless rarely get positions with structural leverage.

**Institutional gatekeeping:** Media platforms, professional credentials, organizational leadership—all are gatekept by existing power structures. Havel could leverage his dissident playwright status partly because he had cultural capital from before. Marginalized people rarely get those platforms.

**One-shot opportunities:** Many leverage acts destroy the individual's future access. Whistleblowers get prosecuted, defecting officials get exiled, visible leaders get assassinated. Using structural leverage often means sacrificing it—making these one-time opportunities.

**Collective dependency:** Even positions with apparent individual leverage usually depend on collective response. Military defectors need troops willing to follow. Whistleblowers need media outlets willing to publish. Moral extremity needs movements ready to mobilize.

The [[Iranian Revolution]] succeeded partly because military units defected or stayed neutral in final days—but those defections came after months of mass protests demonstrating the Shah's isolation. Soldiers weren't making autonomous decisions; they were responding to visible evidence that the regime had lost legitimacy. Individual structural leverage expressed collective reality.

This means: **treating structural power as alternative to numerical power is usually wrong. They're interactive, not substitutes.**

## Everyday Resistance and Cumulative Power

Between mass mobilization and high-leverage positions exists a vast terrain of everyday resistance—small acts that individually accomplish little but cumulatively erode systems.

James C. Scott called these "weapons of the weak": foot-dragging, feigned ignorance, pilfering, work slowdowns, sabotage, rumors, cultural resistance. Not organized collective action, but dispersed individual acts that, aggregated, impose costs and constrain power.

[[Polish Solidarity]] during martial law (1981-1989) survived partly through everyday resistance when mass demonstrations were impossible. Workers did "work-to-rule"—following regulations so literally that production slowed. Underground culture thrived. Small acts of defiance accumulated: wearing Solidarity buttons, painting graffiti, circulating samizdat.

None of these acts individually threatened the regime. But collectively they maintained oppositional culture, made governance harder, and prepared the organizational capacity that emerged when political opening came.

Similarly, [[South African Anti-Apartheid]] resistance wasn't only mass demonstrations and armed struggle. It was also everyday refusals: using "whites only" facilities, wearing ANC colors, singing freedom songs, maintaining cultural pride, teaching banned history. Over decades, this cultural resistance sustained communities and eroded the normalization apartheid required.

The power of everyday resistance is its accessibility—no high-leverage position required, no mass coordination needed. The weakness is its cumulativeness—effects only matter aggregated over time and space, making them hard to measure and easy to dismiss.

Strategically, everyday resistance can:
- Maintain oppositional culture during repressive periods
- Impose costs on enforcement (more agents needed)
- Prepare capacity for mobilization when opportunities arise
- Demonstrate that regime hasn't won consent

But it can also become substitute for more confrontational action—people feeling like they're resisting without taking risks that might actually threaten power.

## Strategic Implications

Understanding structural vs. numerical power has several strategic implications:

**1. Leverage is context-dependent.** What gives power in one system differs in another. Understanding your specific context's leverage points is essential. Where are critical nodes? Who occupies them? What would shift their calculations?

[[Tunisian Revolution]] succeeded partly because professional associations (doctors, lawyers, teachers) could coordinate strikes that paralyzed services. In Tunisia's mid-sized economy, professional strikes had economic leverage. In China's massive economy, similar strikes might be more easily absorbed.

**2. Movements should position people strategically.** Rather than treating existing positions as given, movements can sometimes place sympathetic people in leverage positions or create new positions with leverage.

[[Polish Solidarity]] explicitly organized workplace representatives, creating distributed leadership throughout industries. When martial law came, this distributed structure meant regime couldn't decapitate the movement—too many people in too many places had local leverage.

**3. Individual acts matter more when collective infrastructure exists.** Snowden's leaks mattered because journalism and civil society organizations could amplify them. Bouazizi's self-immolation mattered because Tunisian organizers could mobilize. Without that infrastructure, individual acts dissipate.

This implies: **building collective capacity makes individual leverage more effective.**

**4. Structural positions are often traps.** Gaining institutional access often requires compromising with power. The positions with most leverage are typically occupied by people most loyal to existing systems—selected specifically for that loyalty.

[[Egyptian Revolution 2011]] and [[Sudanese Revolution]] both removed dictators but couldn't prevent military coups because movements lacked institutional positions within the military. The military's structural power (guns, organization, chain of command) overwhelmed the street movements' numerical power once initial protests succeeded.

**5. Creating crises can matter more than occupying positions.** If you can't get structural leverage directly, you might create situations where leverage-holders must choose sides.

[[Serbian Otpor]] couldn't occupy state institutions, but through persistent creative protests and election monitoring, they created a crisis that forced military and police to choose: defend Milošević or defect. Enough chose defection.

## When Violence Looks Tempting

This analysis illuminates why violence seems attractive from a power perspective. A small armed cell can have disproportionate impact without solving collective action problems. Terrorism creates leverage through creating crises rather than occupying structural positions.

But (and this is crucial for [[Essay 3]]), violence works fundamentally differently than other forms of structural power. Whistleblowers leverage information. Defectors leverage institutional position. Moral extremity leverage symbolic resonance.

Violence leverages fear and destruction. This changes everything about who supports you, what you can achieve, and who you become. Before exploring that trap, we need to understand information dynamics in resistance.
