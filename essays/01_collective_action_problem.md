# Why Resistance is Hard: The Mathematics of Mass Action

## Introduction

On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus. Her act of defiance became legendary—but not because individual defiance is powerful. Parks had been arrested before for similar protests. Other Black passengers had been arrested. Individual acts of resistance, no matter how courageous, rarely change systems.

What made December 1, 1955 different was what happened next: within days, thousands of Montgomery's Black residents coordinated a boycott of the city's buses. They maintained this boycott for 381 days. The buses ran mostly empty. The city lost money. The system changed.

This is the fundamental paradox of resistance: individual defiance is easy but ineffective; mass action is powerful but extraordinarily difficult to achieve. Understanding why mass coordination is so hard—and how successful movements overcome these challenges—is essential to understanding when resistance succeeds or fails.

## The Paradox of Power in Numbers

The mathematics of resistance are brutally simple. A system's power depends on compliance. When enough people withdraw that compliance simultaneously, the system cannot function. A general strike, sustained boycott, or mass civil disobedience can bring down governments, change laws, transform social norms.

But this power only manifests at scale. Ten people refusing to ride the bus is an inconvenience. Ten thousand people is an economic crisis. One person marching is invisible. One million people is a political earthquake.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: individuals need collective action to be effective, but collective action requires individuals to risk participation before they know if others will join them. You must commit before you know if you're part of a powerful movement or an isolated gesture that accomplishes nothing except marking you for retaliation.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott succeeded because organizers—building on decades of previous organizing by the NAACP, Women's Political Council, and others—convinced tens of thousands of people to make this leap of faith simultaneously. They created systems to sustain coordination: alternative transportation networks, mass meetings for morale and decision-making, enforcement mechanisms to prevent defection, and visible evidence that others were participating.

In 2011, Occupy Wall Street faced the same mathematics. The occupiers were visible, their message resonated, they generated media attention. But they couldn't solve the fundamental coordination problem: how to translate attention into sustained mass participation. Most sympathizers remained sympathizers—consuming content, agreeing with critiques—rather than participants. The camps never mobilized the numbers needed to impose economic or political costs sufficient to force concessions. Eventually, isolated and unable to scale, the occupations were cleared.

The difference wasn't courage or commitment—Occupy participants risked arrest and police violence. The difference was that Montgomery organizers solved the collective action problem and Occupy didn't.

## The Free Rider Problem

Economist Mancur Olson identified a fundamental challenge to collective action: the free rider problem. In any mass movement, each individual benefits if the movement succeeds, regardless of whether that individual participated. If the Montgomery Bus Boycott defeats segregation, all Black residents benefit—including those who continued riding buses and bore no risk.

This creates perverse incentives. From a purely self-interested perspective, the optimal strategy is to let others take risks while you benefit from their success. If the movement succeeds without you, you win without cost. If it fails, you haven't exposed yourself to retaliation. Either way, free riding seems rational.

The problem deepens because your individual participation rarely determines the outcome. In a movement of thousands or millions, one more or fewer participant makes almost no difference. So even if you would gladly participate in a successful movement, you might rationally conclude that your participation doesn't matter—making non-participation a rational choice even for people who support the cause.

This logic, if universally applied, predicts that mass movements should rarely occur. Yet they do. How?

Successful movements employ multiple strategies to overcome free riding:

**Selective incentives:** Montgomery organizers didn't just appeal to principle—they created carpools, making non-participation less convenient. Polish Solidarity wasn't just a political movement—it was the only independent union that could defend workers' immediate interests. Participation became individually rational apart from collective outcomes.

**Social pressure and monitoring:** In tight-knit communities, free riding carries social costs. Montgomery's Black churches provided both organizing infrastructure and social accountability. In the American South's segregated communities, everyone knew who was riding the buses and who wasn't. Social sanction made participation easier than defection.

**Changing the calculus:** Some movements succeed by making non-participation risky. The Gdańsk shipyard workers in 1980 Poland struck knowing that security forces might intervene. But they also knew that if they didn't strike, working conditions would deteriorate and the regime would remain unchanged. The status quo became less acceptable than resistance.

**Identity and meaning:** Pure economic self-interest is not the only—or even primary—human motivation. People participate in movements for dignity, solidarity, identity, and meaning. Montgomery participants weren't just avoiding segregated buses—they were asserting their humanity and rejecting subordination. The value wasn't just in the policy outcome but in the act of resistance itself.

The most successful movements combine all these approaches. But the free rider problem never disappears—it must be actively managed. When movements fail to provide selective incentives, maintain social accountability, or sustain meaning and identity, participation erodes even if people still support the goals.

## Coordination Costs

Even when people want to participate and the free rider problem is overcome, actually coordinating thousands of people is staggeringly difficult.

**Communication challenges:** Before participation, potential participants must know (1) that action is happening, (2) when and where, (3) what specific actions to take, and (4) that enough others are participating to make it worthwhile. Each link in this chain can fail.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott succeeded partly because organizers had multiple communication channels: Black churches where information could be shared from pulpits, ministers who coordinated among churches, the Women's Political Council's telephone networks, and ultimately leaflets distributed throughout Black neighborhoods. They used redundant systems because they knew single channels would be insufficient.

In authoritarian contexts, communication is harder. Poland's Solidarity initially coordinated strikes through workplace networks and then developed underground distribution systems during martial law—printing and distributing newsletters at tremendous personal risk. When official media was controlled and unofficial communication criminalized, simply telling people about planned action became a major operational challenge.

Digital technology promised to solve communication challenges. The Arab Spring protests, Occupy Wall Street, and Hong Kong's 2019 protests all relied heavily on social media for coordination. And indeed, digital tools enable communication at scales and speeds previously impossible.

But technology creates new problems. Digital communication is surveilled. Hong Kong protesters developed sophisticated use of encrypted apps and offline distribution, knowing that their phones were potentially tracked. Even then, the constant risk of infiltration and identification remained.

Moreover, digital communication can create an illusion of coordination. Thousands of people liking a post or sharing an event isn't the same as thousands of people showing up. The gap between digital expression of support and physical participation is vast. Occupy learned this painfully—huge online followings didn't translate into sufficient sustained participation.

**Trust requirements:** Coordination requires trust that others will follow through. In one-time actions, this is manageable. But sustained campaigns require ongoing trust despite inevitable setbacks, provocations, and exhaustion.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott organizers built trust through existing institutions—churches that had served communities for decades, leaders known and respected, organizational track records. When Martin Luther King Jr. called for continued boycott despite hardship, people trusted him partly because they trusted the institutions backing him.

Conversely, when movements lack institutional foundations, maintaining trust is harder. Occupy's deliberate leaderlessness meant no one could speak authoritatively for the movement, making it difficult to coordinate strategy or negotiate. What began as a principled rejection of hierarchy became a practical obstacle to sustained coordination.

**Temporal synchronization:** Actions must happen at the right time. Too early, and participation is insufficient; too late, and the moment passes. Montgomery organizers had to move quickly after Parks's arrest to capitalize on outrage while it was fresh, but not so quickly that people couldn't prepare or spread the word. This timing required sophisticated judgment and rapid communication.

**Maintaining commitment over time:** Even when initial coordination succeeds, sustaining participation is its own challenge. The Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted 381 days. Polish Solidarity existed legally for 16 months, then underground for seven years before achieving victory. People had to maintain commitment through exhaustion, retaliation, slow progress, and uncertainty about outcome.

Successful sustained campaigns develop rituals and rhythms that make participation habitual rather than requiring constant re-decision. Montgomery's mass meetings served this function—weekly reinforcement of solidarity, information sharing, collective encouragement. These weren't just logistical necessities; they were mechanisms to sustain coordination over time.

## Visibility vs. Security

Every act of coordination faces a dilemma: to coordinate, the movement must be visible to potential participants; but visibility makes the movement visible to opponents who can disrupt or repress it.

Montgomery organizers wanted maximum visibility for the boycott—they needed every Black bus rider to know about it and see others participating. But they also needed to protect leaders from retaliation (though they ultimately couldn't—King and others were arrested, bombed, threatened). They needed to balance publicity with operational security.

This tension intensifies under repressive regimes. When the U.S. Civil Rights Movement faced beatings and arrests, participants still had some legal protections and public visibility created international pressure that constrained violence (though not enough to prevent murders). When Tiananmen Square protesters made themselves visible to the Chinese state, they were massacred—visibility brought no protection and enabled comprehensive repression.

The digital age transforms this dilemma. Social media enables unprecedented coordination speed and scale—Hong Kong's 2019 protests mobilized millions partly through digital coordination. But digital presence is digital evidence. Every photo shared, every encrypted message, every social media post becomes potential evidence for prosecution once the state decides to repress.

Hong Kong protesters developed remarkable operational security practices: using encrypted apps, burner phones, cash instead of traceable cards, wearing masks, destroying Octopus cards (Hong Kong's transit card that tracks movement), using laser pointers to blind facial recognition cameras. Yet these measures could only mitigate, not eliminate, the fundamental trade-off—some visibility was necessary to coordinate, but all visibility was evidence.

The National Security Law imposed in 2020 exploited this accumulated evidence. Digital footprints that seemed safe during mass protests became prosecution evidence once the state chose mass repression. The same tools that enabled coordination enabled, months later, systematic arrests.

There's no perfect solution to the visibility-security trade-off. Successful movements make strategic choices based on their specific context. In relatively open societies, transparency can be protective—visible movements are harder to repress without generating sympathy. Under authoritarianism, operational security becomes paramount, even at the cost of coordination efficiency.

## Delayed and Uncertain Gratification

Finally, resistance movements must convince people to accept costs now for uncertain benefits later—possibly much later.

Rosa Parks and other Montgomery activists endured a year of walking to work in Alabama heat, organizing carpools, and facing white backlash. The Supreme Court ruling desegregating buses came 381 days after the boycott began. Polish Solidarity members struck in 1980, lived through martial law repression from 1981-1989, and finally saw democracy in 1989—nine years after the initial strikes, seven years underground.

This temporal dimension makes coordination harder in several ways:

**Uncertainty compounds over time:** In the short term, you might assess your chances and accept risk. Over years, uncertainty accumulates. Will the movement sustain? Will victory be possible? Will the personal costs be worth it? This uncertainty erodes participation.

**Fatigue and burnout:** Sustaining high-intensity participation is exhausting. Montgomery organizers had to constantly recruit new energy, support those ready to give up, and pace the campaign to prevent complete burnout.

**Changing circumstances:** Over extended periods, people's lives change. They move, start families, get sick, change priorities. Movements that require years-long commitment must account for natural attrition and constantly recruit new participants.

**Small wins as strategy:** To sustain participation despite delayed ultimate victory, successful movements create intermediate goals that provide evidence of progress and reward for participation. Montgomery's mid-campaign victories (legal filings progressing, international attention, small concessions from the city) sustained morale when ultimate victory remained distant.

But small wins carry risks. If intermediate concessions satisfy enough participants, the movement may demobilize before achieving larger goals. Movement leaders must calibrate—celebrate wins to sustain morale, but maintain pressure for transformative change.

## Why Some Movements Succeed Despite Everything

Given these extraordinary challenges, we might wonder how movements ever succeed. The answer is not that successful movements eliminate these problems—they manage them.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott succeeded because:
- Decades of prior organizing by the NAACP and others had built institutional capacity and trust
- The boycott provided immediate individual benefit (dignity, resistance to humiliation) beyond collective outcome
- Tight-knit communities enabled social accountability that reduced free-riding
- Alternative transportation systems made participation practical
- Regular mass meetings sustained coordination and morale
- The specific demand (bus desegregation) was clear and achievable
- Media attention created international pressure that constrained violence

Polish Solidarity succeeded because:
- It met immediate worker needs (independent union representation), making participation individually rational
- The Catholic Church provided sanctuary institutions beyond state control
- Dense workplace networks enabled trust and coordination
- Seven years of underground organizing built organizational resilience
- Gorbachev's reforms in the USSR changed the international context
- The negotiated transition offered regime elites an acceptable exit

Conversely, movements fail when they can't solve these problems. Occupy Wall Street generated sympathy but couldn't translate it into sustained mass participation. Tiananmen Square protesters coordinated massive demonstrations but had no institutional base to sustain organization when repression came. Hong Kong's 2019 movement mobilized millions but couldn't impose sufficient costs on Beijing to force concessions, and leaderless structure prevented strategic adaptation when tactics failed.

## Conclusion: The Problem Violence "Solves"

Understanding these coordination challenges illuminates why violence is tempting. A lone gunman doesn't need to coordinate with thousands of people. A small cell of bombers doesn't face free-rider problems. Terrorism achieves visibility without requiring mass participation.

Violence offers a solution to the collective action problem—but at catastrophic cost. It changes who you are, what you can achieve, and who will support you. Most importantly, as we'll explore in the next essay, it plays directly into state power rather than challenging it.

But before examining why violence fails strategically, we must understand another dimension of the coordination problem: why some individuals have structural positions that let them act alone with significant impact, while others can only act collectively. When does individual action matter?
